Hello, Welcome to Extended Mind. 
This project was impart inspired by Alfred Gell's anthropological theory found in his book, Art & Agency. Essentially, he proposed that the creative and productive work of artists spanned more than a one-way timeline and really took on a x & y dimensional status. While this project does not break down agency and forms, It does bring the idea of dimenstionality to a typical timeline view of an artists output.
