Before the album came out, they billed themselves as the Reflektors, with a fake website, a fake album, a bunch of secret shows, and some top-heavy papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks. As this new band, they were reborn on the dance floor. No longer just po-faced helmet bangers and nostalgia merchants using Google Maps to make people cry, now they had synths and beats and a silver sparkle with James Murphy and Haitian kompa and rara music all celebrating with joie de vivre under the mirror ball.\nWho Arcade Fire became on their new album Everything Now\u2014a tangled, joyless record of Banksy disco and bloodless new wave that examines fear, love, and suicide in our modern media landscape\u2014is anyone\u2019s guess. Before its release, they created a fake \u201cglobal media and e-commerce platform\u201d called Everything Now, a brand play that spawned Creature Comfort cereal, engaged with KFC\u2019s Twitter account, and published \u201cfake news\u201d websites, one of which was a satirical review of the record in question. The aim of their online theatre, apparently, was to bolster some of the record\u2019s themes of infinite consumerism in media, the overwhelming anxiety of the moment, the recursive loop of technology\u2014sex, drugs, and Marshall McLuhan.\nIt would be one thing if the tiresome rollout ran contrary to its music\u2014a bit of cosmic brain Twitter irony to temper another earnest Arcade Fire album. But Everything Now attempts to capture life within and without the content loop\u2014the paranoia, narcissism, and \u201ccreature comforts\u201d within; the love and fear without. It\u2019s a worthy undertaking because this kind of acute despair feels more pervasive than ever. Things have changed since OK Computer asked and answered a lot of these questions. Now it\u2019s not a dread that looms large, it\u2019s a pronounced daily trauma, one self-inflicted by simply logging on and making yourself available as a marketing target.\nBut on Everything Now, Arcade Fire aren\u2019t lifeboats for our ennui, they\u2019re scolds. Their self-reflexive mood and half-baked critiques have landed all over the record\u2019s grooves. The \u201csociety, man\u201d songs are riddled with cliche, and the love songs are a bore. If ever you faulted Arcade Fire for their unmoored passion, their art-school busking aesthetic, their words lousy with import and meaning, you have to admit at least they sounded like they gave a shit. The charmless air of Everything Now captured by Arcade Fire\u2019s six-person lineup\u2014with the aid of Daft Punk\u2019s Thomas Bangalter, Beak>\u2019s Geoff Barrow, and Pulp bassist Steve Mackey, among others\u2014creates an atmosphere of self-loathing and dim romance, housing two separate songs whose lyrics are \u201cInfinite content/Infinite content/We\u2019re infinitely content.\u201d For a band who discovered themselves in sincerity, they are thoroughly lost when they bet it all on cynicism.\nNever mind that Win Butler\u2014who once burst forth from the mix to holler from his heart, singing hallelujah\u2014now just intones his words in this dry, accusatory tone. Never mind that he asks you if you \u201cwant to get messed up,\u201d preaches at the pulpit about boys and girls who hate themselves, and then just raps all seven days of the week at one point. Never mind that the record falls off a cliff with the painful dub-synth disaster \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d a song so starchy and grooveless it seems impossible they could write anything worse. Never mind that they do write something worse with \u201cChemistry,\u201d the sound of Billy Squier pouring warm milk over the concept of reggae.\nThese are all just bad omens on the way to realizing Everything Now is trapped in lyrical and musical stasis. Conceptually, the songs don\u2019t transcend their social critique, they succumb to it. Musically, they don\u2019t have momentum, they simply fight inertia. The warmer back half of the record is at war with itself, trying to pull real feelings up from arrangements that are topographically dull and looped out much longer than they need to be. \u201cPut Your Money on Me\u201d pulls off a neat melodic shift halfway through (cribbed from the chorus of \u201cDancing Queen\u201d) but then runs out of ideas, relying instead on a tired synth bassline. It\u2019s whiplash to go from the scrappy, orchestrated new wave-pop of \u201cWe Exist\u201d to something this anemic, as if the only lesson they took from dance music is that songs should, above all, alternate between two chords.\nArcade Fire used to be goobers whose bombast and sanctimony were forgiven because their music was so dazzling. They made a simple blues progression seem like an ocean on \u201cKeep the Car Running.\u201d And live, I mean, to watch Richard Reed Perry go to war with a concert bass drum, or to watch R\u00e9gine Chassagne stare transfixed as she sings of Haiti or to watch the entire band rev up a dance pit with \u201cHere Comes the Night Time\u201d is to see why they became iconoclasts 13 years ago, simply by giving so much space to people who didn\u2019t care about being cool. Like U2 and Bruce Springsteen before them, Arcade Fire songs aren\u2019t measured by their length or chart placement, they\u2019re measured by their area, and how many people they gather to emote within it.\nBut here in the claustrophobic space of Everything Now, the warts of Arcade Fire are impossible to miss. Map the vocal melody on \u201cNo Cars Go\u201d or \u201cSprawl II\u201d with your finger in the air and you\u2019ll arc it up and down in peaks and valleys. Do the same thing with the turgid and thoughtless \u201cCreature Comfort\u201d or \u201cPeter Pan\u201d or \u201cSigns of Life\u201d and your finger will barely move.  Butler\u2019s commitment to the detached frontman where singing occurs barely or not at all robs songs of their emotional largesse, that basic thing we licensed to Arcade Fire and upon which their entire identity relies.\nWhat saving grace there is on Everything Now is scattered throughout its mercifully short 47 minutes. The title track, one last reverie before the darkness, shines much like its counterpart on Reflektor. Those unison strings and piano, that four-on-the-floor beat, the exalting choir behind the band, Patrick Bebey\u2019s pygmy flute performance: it\u2019s a treasure. Sure, the chorus is Win Butler getting wistful and bitter about how he, too, is allowed everything all of the time, but it\u2019s upheld by the life of the music around it. Butler manages to fight through all his doubt on the touching finale \u201cWe Don\u2019t Deserve Love,\u201d a woozy, protracted sunrise, a full-band capitulation to feeling at end of a bleak, anti-celebratory album. These and the filigrees of Chassagne\u2019s voice on the standout \u201cElectric Blue\u201d\u2014specifically when it helixes up into the stratosphere near the end\u2014are to be clung to and cherished as deeply human moments on a record desperately in need of them.\nWhich is to say that Everything Now succeeds in concept alone: It is an album about a once and possibly future great band trapped in its own feedback loop (the digital download is indeed sequenced for infinite content: the final track \u201cEverything Now (Continued)\u201d connects seamlessly with the intro \u201cEverything_Now (Continued)\u201d). But it belies to such a great degree what we\u2019ve come to love about Arcade Fire in the first place. On \u201cCreature Comfort,\u201d Butler sings about someone attempting suicide while listening to Funeral. In the world of Everything Now, it works as this shocking, bemused moment of interconnectivity. The way he sings it\u2014almost in passing\u2014fits with the dazed and dead tone Butler conveys through his lyrics. But in the world outside the record, it\u2019s callous and obnoxious, unpacked without grace or taste by a band who are historically committed to helping out those in need. Is this who they fear they\u2019ll become, or is this who they have become? It\u2019s a question the album fails to answer.\n", "Arcade Fire_Reflektor (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Arcade Fire_Reflektor": "It's likely that the first time you heard the Arcade Fire's monstrously anticipated fourth album Reflektor, you were\u2014to borrow a phrase that\u00a0Win Butler spits out like a bite of bad food during the record's disco-noir\u00a0title track\u2014\"staring at a screen.\" This past Thursday, the band posted to Youtube an 85-minute video which cued up the entirety of the double-album to visuals from Marcel Camus' kaleidoscopic 1959 film Black Orpheus. If something that happens on the internet can be considered An Event, then this certainly was one; in the same moment I saw the band's official tweet announcing it, two people simultaneously instant-messaged me the link.\u00a0It was late afternoon on the East Coast, lunchtime on the West, and in that moment I did exactly what thousands of other people in those and all other time zones did: Stopped what I was doing, closed some extraneous tabs and programs, and listened. The auto-updating comments became a chronicle of knee-jerk first impressions: fervent gushing (\"The bassline on 'Joan of Arc' is fucking epic\"), groan-worthy puns (\"I can't even reflect how excited this makes me!\"), and egregious misspellings (\"I don't understand what all the fuzz is about\").\u00a0This scene would have seemed bizarre\u2014and likely a little sad\u2014 to us decades ago, and it's frightening to imagine how quaint it will seem in the future. But this is how a lot of people at this moment in time\u2014the one in which Reflektor was made, and the one it distrustfully interrogates\u2014discover new music: Alone; together.\nAll four of the Montreal-based band's albums have been about the tension between those two words, taking up subjects like suburban isolation and the false community of religiosity, but Reflektor is larger, at least in scope, than anything Arcade Fire have done before. Of course, the stakes have been raised considerably since we've last heard from them: Their previous album, The Suburbs, was the unexpected winner of the Grammy for 2011's Album of the Year. And yet,\u00a0no one involved in this record sounds to be resting on the laurels of their achievements\u2014that includes producer and\u00a0LCD Soundsystem\u00a0retiree\u00a0James Murphy.\u00a0Reflektor is a triumph, but not a victory lap; the band never sounds content enough for that.\nThis is instead an anxious, occasionally downright paranoid album that asks big, barbed questions aimed not just at the man who may or may not be upstairs, but the more terrestrial gods of rock history, too. With either Ziggy Stardust, the Fly, or maybe that first guy who played Daft Punk to the rock kids as their guide, Arcade Fire have spiked their usual clenched-fist earnestness with a small but welcome pinch of irony\u2014and this is what makes it feel vital in a way that a lot of recent guitar-based music is not. \"Do you like rock'n'roll music?\" Butler asks in a mock-Elvis shudder at the beginning of glam-rock earthquake \"Normal Person\". \"Cuz I don't know if I do\u2026\" The only way to make a Big Rock Record in 2013 is to make one that is skeptical of what it means to be a Big Rock Record in 2013.\nOn their last tour, the Arcade Fire played for the first time in Haiti, the country where vocalist/multi-instrumentalist R\u00e9gine Chassagne's parents were born. Their time there served as the inspiration for Reflektor; Butler spoke recently about the experience of playing for audiences who'd never heard many of the classic rock groups we take for granted, and instead \"connecting to people on a purely rhythmic, musical level\u2026completely stripped of context.\" You can hear the Caribbean influence in Reflektor's emphasis on kinetic rhythms and deep grooves, but also in its somewhat irreverent attitude towards Anglo rock history. Reflektor is at once nostalgic for\u2014its sense of sprawl feels like a throwback to the heyday of AOR\u2014and iconoclastic about the past. It sounds like it has ingested a bunch of the great art-rock records you're \"supposed\" to learn to appreciate in your formative listening years\u2014Low, Remain in Light, Exile on Main Street, The White Album, Here Come the Warm Jets\u2014 and thrown them into the fire, in an attempt to make new shapes from the smoke.\nReflektor's sound is lush and imaginative, but never in a way that suffocates you with the fumes of its polish. It's limber and loose, as though the songs were performed live; the arrangements breathe, seethe, and sweat. As their detractors will be quick to point out, Arcade Fire's greatest crime in the past has been sometimes coming off too stately and self-serious (The Suburbs\u00a0in particular had a buttoned-up quality that failed to capture the frenzied energy of their live shows), but on the first half of Reflektor they often feel like they're deflating their own sense of grandeur. It's nice to hear a band that showed up on the scene quite literally dressed for a funeral now sounding like they're having (at least a little) fun.\nGoofy asides, unexpected left-turns, and tiny imperfections bring these songs to life: Check the odd, muttered phrases scattered throughout the intros, the parts on \"Normal Person\" when Tim Kingsbury's high E string seems to get clipped by the fretboard, or, maybe most thrillingly, the tempo fake-outs in \"Here Comes the Night Time\". That song, one of the album's best, begins with a celebratory Carnival beat, but then\u2014the sonic equivalent to the tricks they've been playing in recent concerts and TV performances\u2014suddenly switches to a slower, dub-inflected pace. There's a charming scrappiness to that moment as the band reorients to the rhythm, like a marching band suddenly realizing they're going the wrong way and trying, calamitously, to turn around.\nThere's always been a physicality about the Arcade Fire's sound\u2014we're talking, after all, about a band whose members used to find it necessary to wear helmets on stage\u2014but the rhythm section has never popped on one of their albums the way it does here. That emphasis has Murphy's stamp all over it (Butler says they all learned an important lesson early in the recording: \"If you can get James tapping his foot, you know you're on the right track\"), and so do the punched-up backing vocals. This is the first Arcade Fire album on which Chassagne doesn't sing lead, but her crisp, smartly arranged harmonies on songs like \"Reflektor\", \"It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus)\", and \"Joan of Arc\" make her a major presence. (Same goes for Colin Stetson, who did the album's horn arrangements and whose uneasy bass sax is the title track's secret weapon.) Even Reflektor's most straightforward pop songs like \"Joan of Arc\" and \"We Exist\" are fractured and haunted, reminiscent of the way Achtung Baby summoned the ghosts that had always been dormant in U2. When people talk about Murphy's production on Reflektor, the Eno comparisons will be obvious, unavoidable, and earned.\nReflektor unfolds over two discs, and which you prefer will depend on how many packets of earnest magnificence you take in your Arcade Fire. Disc 1 is raw and grounded; Disc 2 is airier, more cosmic, and a little less self-aware. The record's most divisive song is the second half's centerpiece, \"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\", which\u2014Julie Taymor style\u2014aims to be nothing less than all the Beatles songs at once (\"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution 9\" included). It inevitably falls short, but it's hard not to admire the effort. Lyrically if not sonically, the album's weakest link is the slinky \"Porno\", whose heavy-handed lyrics (\"Take the make-up off your eyes\u2026Little boys with their porno/ They don't know what we know\") feel a bit too much like bleeding-heart teenage poetry. And yet, even if the shoulda-been-B-side \"Porno\" feels like a lapse in judgment, it springs from the same source that helps the band continue to be so vital. Arcade Fire are eternal, defiantly emotive teenagers, and that's what kept them sounding like genuine underdogs even as they've become one of the biggest bands in the world. Nearly a decade after Funeral, Butler still sings like everything is at stake. For this band, growing up has not meant cooling the flames so much as beckoning them higher. The figures at the center of the Side 2 suite of \"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\" and the wonderfully Cocteau-glacial \"It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus)\" are not the Springsteenian everypeople of Funeral and Neon Bible, but instead the star-crossed lovers in a Greek myth.\nAnd yet, even on Disc 2 it's hard to shake the feeling that Orpheus and Eurydice are just the B-plot; the great love story on Reflektor is the one between music and listener. With its clipped snippets of airwave chatter (the BBC's Jonathan Ross makes a cameo), warped VHS hum, and retro-luminosity that nods to a time when synthesizers connoted un-jaded wonder and revelation, Reflektor is designed to be an homage to the many ways music is transmitted, discovered, and incorporated into people's lives. Chassagne has said that her earliest and most stirring musical memories were \"listening to [her] neighbor's music, the sounds coming through the walls\" and then trying to replicate them on piano; in the same interview, the Texas-born Butler spoke similarly about U2's (much maligned) Pop Mart tour. Reflektor's scope is vast enough that it speaks to both of these experiences\u2014and to our own. In the end, it doesn't feel like a critique of this screen-glazed moment so much as a validation of it. They've given us something in the present tense that, these days, feels depressingly unfashionable: An Event\u2014an album that dares to be great, and remarkably succeeds.\n", "Arcade Fire_The Suburbs (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Arcade Fire_The Suburbs": "Arcade Fire never aim for anything less than grand statements. That quality has played a huge role in making them very, very popular; it's also their greatest weakness. Funeral was wracked with agony and grief, but what made it one of the transcendent records of the 2000s was that it avoided easy answers. It proposed that the fight of our lives is just that, a fight, but a winnable one. But when they turned that same all-or-nothing intensity outward on Neon Bible, otherwise propulsive and elegant songs were sometimes bogged down by overblown arrangements or pedantic political statements. You'd figure an album bluntly called The Suburbs that focuses on The Way We Live might repeat some of Neon Bible's worst tendencies. Instead, it's a satisfying return to form-- proof that Arcade Fire can still make grand statements without sounding like they're carrying the weight of the world.\nThe metrics of The Suburbs are misleading: At 16 tracks, including interludes and multi-part songs, it might seem like Arcade Fire are shooting for their\u00a0Sandinista!, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, or Sign O' The Times-- a band at the peak of their powers reacting against the walls closing in by blowing everything up and trying anything. But the album actually plays out more like Bruce Springsteen's\u00a0The River, a generously paced collection of meditations on familial responsibility, private disappointments, and fleeting youth, much of which takes place in moving vehicles*.* It also reintroduces much-needed levity to an act that can be overbearingly self-serious. On the deceptively chipper chamber pop of \"Rococo\", Win Butler borders on patronizing, evoking Nirvana's \"In Bloom\" and using the title word as a sword to skewer an easy target: the hipster more concerned with following trends than locating a genuine understanding in the world around him. But the point is that Butler values directness and truth, and throughout The Suburbs, what he lacks in poetry, he makes up for with honesty.\nThere's a tension between the uneasily resolving chords and lightfooted piano shuffle on the title track, as Butler sings in a restrained falsetto: \"Sometimes I can't believe it/ I'm moving past the feeling.\" As The Suburbs plays out, that \"feeling\" is one that lived on Funeral and is dying here. The initial fantasy of Funeral was escaping the neighborhood, dancing beneath the police lights, and living on misbehavior. The Suburbs can be seen as the update decades later, with those same kids having kids of their own, and moving back to and struggling in the same neighborhoods.\nThe heavy-handedness that marred some of Neon Bible mostly resulted from Butler's\u00a0warning us of destruction caused by the lies of authority figures-- shady cultural impresarios, corrupt church leaders, politicians all too eager to push the button. But what makes The Suburbs a more humane and empathetic record is that Butler and\u00a0R\u00e9gine Chassagne\u00a0have come to terms with how the pain of our day-to-day lives more often results from the lies we tell ourselves. At the outset of \"We Used to Wait\", staccato, minor-key piano chords evoke anxiety. The song is a simple lament about the exhaustion from a relentless pace of life that demands everything immediately. But as Jeremy Gara's steady drums lift the piece into cathedral drama, it's obvious that there's a deeper concern than the antiquation of letter-writing. By the time the narrator finds himself with \"the lights cut out... left standing in the wilderness downtown,\" it's a sad reminder that giving up your dreams for a reliable job that pays your way and corrodes your soul isn't even a reliable option anymore. Soul-sucking work was at least once a dependably secure and profitable enterprise. Now what do we do?\nThe bulk of The Suburbs focuses on this quiet desperation borne of compounding the pain of wasting your time as an adult by romanticizing the wasted time of your youth. As bleak as the lyrics are, though, they're buoyed by the band's leanest, loosest songwriting yet. These songs are busy, but never overly complicated, subtly nudging at their boundaries while allowing wide lanes for Butler's perfectly memorable melodic turns. The framework is familiar: Arcade Fire's trademark of decorating AOR with orchestral fringe (\"Ready to Start\", \"Empty Room\"), sun-baked Harvest gold (\"Wasted Hours\", \"Suburban War\"), and in the record's highlights, pulsating electro (\"Half Light II [No Celebration]\", \"Sprawl II [Mountains Beyond Mountains]\").\nBut The Suburbs is a record that seeks to build, and it reaches a monumental peak at its closure. Both parts of \"Sprawl\" act like a conversation between lovers and a treatise on what makes Arcade Fire tick: Butler's despondence on \"Sprawl I (Flatland)\" matches the desolate atmosphere that surrounds him-- returning to a mall-spackled hometown is an admission of defeat. But as with their first two albums, the penultimate song towers over what came before: \"Sprawl II\" is an Arcade Fire song through and through, balancing a sort of defiance in the midst of crushing circumstance (\"These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose/ But late at night the feelings swim to the surface\"). It's a rare and thrilling example of the group stepping out of their musical comfort zone, an airy disco bounce evoking \"Heart of Glass\" that serves as further evidence of just how crucial the often underappreciated Chassagne is in tempering Butler's grimmer outlook.\nThat said, the relative concision of Funeral and Neon Bible didn't allow for a whole lot of wiggle room. And while it's somewhat heartening to hear something allowed to be a \"minor\" Arcade Fire song, they're still, well, minor. \"Month of May\" strains too much for a ragged punk glory while the folky, Neil Young-ish strummer \"Deep Blue\" doesn't develop its Kasparov vs. IBM metaphor into more than an afterthought. And as The Suburbs reaches its second half, there's certainly some thematic redundancy-- surely, there's already a drinking game revolving around Butler's use of \"the kids.\"\nThere's also the possibility that The Suburbs can be seen as a lesser Arcade Fire album if you mostly value rock music for its escapism. This is another 2010 example of a Boss-indebted band (see also: the National and Titus Andronicus) making epic outpourings of modern disillusionment and disappointment for people who can commiserate and return to fretting about their jobs and bank accounts once the house lights go up. But just because the concerns of The Suburbs are at times mundane, that makes them no less real. And that Arcade Fire can make such powerful art out of recognizing these moments makes our own existences feel worthy of documentation. By dropping Neon Bible's accusatory standpoint, The Suburbs delivers a life-affirming message similar to Funeral's: We're all in this together.\n", "Arcade Fire_The Suburbs (Deluxe Edition)": "No Review", "Arcade Fire_Neon Bible": "Sharing its title with a John Kennedy Toole novel, the Arcade Fire's second album is markedly different from its more cloistered predecessor: On Neon Bible, the band looks outward instead of inward, their concerns more worldly than familial, and their sound more malevolent than cathartic. Angry, embittered, and paranoid, but often generously empathetic in their points of view, they target the government, the church, the military, the entertainment industry, and even the basest instincts of the common man.\nWhile the group's us-against-the-world stance occasionally comes off as slightly self-righteous or reactionary, their scathingly critical perspective gives weight and direction to their nervy earnestness: If Funeral captured the enormity of personal pain, Neon Bible sounds large enough to take on the whole world. This is evident on the album's incantatory opener, \"Black Mirror\", whose title derives from a centuries-old device that supposedly foretold future events and allowed viewers supernatural insight the hearts of men. Here, the band holds that mirror up to the world and captures a malevolent reflection.\nFitting Neon Bible's more worldly concerns, the Arcade Fire have streamlined the raw, large sound of Funeral into something that achieves the same magnitudinous scale through more economical means. Propelled by inventive guitar work and Jeremy Gara's steady drums, the group pares back anything that might curb the controlled forward thrust of songs like \"Black Mirror\", \"Keep the Car Running\", or \"The Well and the Lighthouse\". These songs don't erupt, but gradually crescendo and intensify. Unlike the cathartic Funeral, Neon Bible operates on spring-loaded tension and measured release. As such, it could strike some listeners as a disappointing follow-up, but the record's mix of newfound discipline and passion will likely imbue it with a long shelf-life.\nOn most songs, the Arcade Fire achieve a headlong forward motion, bolstered by immense church organs and Calexico horns that underscore the angst of Butler's bitter, accusatory lyrics. Perhaps the most noticeable (and promising) development in the band's sound is the more prominent role of R\u00e9gine Chassagne. If she once sounded studied or mannered, here her angelic soprano projects a tentative hopefulness, making her a capable foil for Win Butler's tense performance. Her contributions to \"(Antichrist Television Blues)\" and \"Black Wave\" sound like the vocal equivalent of her soaring string arrangements, co-written with Owen Pallet of Final Fantasy.\nThese changes aren't drastic, but they are significant, especially as they reveal new and interesting touchstones for the band's aesthetic. The influences most commonly associated with Funeral were Davids Byrne and Bowie, but on Neon Bible, it's Bruce Springsteen who appears not only in the wordy songs and aggressive shuffle, but in the compression of so many styles and sounds into one messy, exciting burst. \"Ocean of Noise\" shuffles furtively on a shoreline samba, due largely to Tim Kingsbury's bassline, while \"Bad Vibrations\", sung by Chassagne, blends girl-group and new wave performances into a darkly enticing whole. The band never compartmentalizes these styles or consigns them to separate songs, but allows them to blend freely.\nAlthough they've expanded their sound, the Arcade Fire's transition into extroversion isn't always smooth or graceful. Neon Bible is full of clunky lyrics, revealing Butler's tendency to overstate and sensationalize. His rhyme schemes are sometimes too deliberate and set-- and no one should be allowed to use the sort of faux-antiquated sentence construction that pops up in lines like \"I fell into the water black.\" \"Black Mirror\" features one of the record's worst offenders: \"Mirror mirror on the wall/ Show me where them bombs will fall.\" Butler's words, however, have always carried less meaning than the way he sings them and the sound in which his band envelops them, so whenever a line falls flat on Neon Bible, the music, always hurtling forward, picks it up and carries it along.\nLike many indie artists, the Arcade Fire work best in the album format, and Neon Bible runs on a different-- and in some ways more finely tuned-- mechanical system than its predecessor. It's a shapely work, gracefully building to fall away to build again, as the band sustains a mood that's both ominous and exhilarating. Even \"No Cars Go\", which originally appeared on their self-titled debut EP, sounds more powerful here than it did in its previous incarnation. As stand-alone tracks, these songs don't make as much sense, which partly explains why those early leaks were so uninspiring. The danger here is inaccessibility: There's only one natural entry point to Neon Bible, and it's \"Black Mirror\". Everything afterwards flows seamlessly from that song's low rumble and startling imagery-- until the final track.\nVenturing into the lyrical realm of Trent Reznor, album closer \"My Body Is a Cage\" seems too eager to wallow in the sort of pained melodrama that fuels the band's detractors. The real disappointment is that Neon Bible doesn't end with \"No Cars Go\", which easily achieves the release they artfully promise but playfully deny throughout the record's first nine tracks. Not only would it have ended the album on a more generous note, it would have made perfect thematic sense as a final invitation to escape.\nBut despite their conflictedness , the Arcade Fire remain firmly rooted in the here and now. And even as press coverage and fan obsession suggest that the world is making a place for them, the band is still looking for a way to understand that world, and to see it for what it really is-- or at least as it appears in the distorted mirror they hold to it.\n", "Arcade Fire_Funeral": "Mass Gothic\u2019s second album begins and ends with a window. At first, the window is dark; by the end of the record, it\u2019s merely big. Presumably the sun has come up. Between \u201cDark Window\u201d and \u201cBig Window,\u201d this project from Hooray for Earth\u2019s Noel Heroux exudes so much bombast as to become exhausting. While the first Mass Gothic record was essentially a Heroux solo outing, I\u2019ve Tortured You Long Enough loops in his wife, Jessica Zambri, who co-wrote the album and sings throughout. The couple adopts a dynamic reminiscent of Win Butler and R\u00e9gine Chassagne\u2014at many points, I\u2019ve Tortured You betrays its deep desire to be an early Arcade Fire release\u2014but their songwriting choices don't support their incessant swings for the rafters.\nThe album introduces itself with a rhythmic figure pilfered from the Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s \u201cJust Like Honey,\u201d an homage Heroux already paid on Hooray for Earth\u2019s \u201cLast Minute,\u201d from 2011\u2019s True Loves. The Scottish band has clearly colored his approach to songwriting and production: Their haze and grit can be heard throughout his projects, and with Zambri he continues to work in their retro mold. I\u2019ve Tortured You has a delightfully textured production style that blurs guitars, drums, and synths together like a painted background, allowing the singers\u2019 voices to vault to the top of the mix. But Psychocandy balanced its blunt fuzz with a light touch. \u201cJust Like Honey\u201d is both noisy and delicate. I\u2019ve Tortured You loses that nuance, blowing out its engines at every turn.\nPower ballads generally work because they couple their enthusiasm with a certain disarming strangeness. The enthusiasm has to be grounded in something new, something that justifies the excitement. Arcade Fire\u2019s lyrics on Funeral and Neon Bible conjured up imagery of primitivist utopias, of love alchemizing the mind. More recently, Lorde\u2019s compositional whirlwind \u201cGreen Light\u201d swirled together great white sharks and light-up dance floors. The words earned their delivery. Heroux and Zambri use a similarly dramatic vocal style to Butler, Chassagne, and Lorde, but their lyrics weigh down their songs. Their couplets are either trite, like \u201cWhile you lift me in the air/There\u2019s time only to love you,\u201d from \u201cCall Me,\u201d or baffling: \u201cUndersea where the viper glows/And the tragedy isn\u2019t one I know,\u201d Zambri narrates on \u201cThe Goad.\u201d So a snake bioluminesces and nothing happens.\nI\u2019ve Tortured You never lets up on its fist-in-the-air rock eruptions. No small acoustic numbers punctuate the record; there is no time to regroup. Even within songs, Heroux and Zambri follow safe, predictable progressions. Multiple tracks reiterate a single vocal melody for their entire duration: no verse, no chorus, just the same stanza over and over. By the end, the window imagery that frames the album feels like a self-conscious metaphor. \u201cI am looking out there/Big window,\u201d Zambri repeats on closer \u201cBig Window.\u201d She does not tell us what she sees. Over pounding drums and roiling electric guitar, she issues the record\u2019s final lyric in a voice that sounds like it wants to rouse stadiums: \u201cIt never happened.\u201d The \u201cit\u201d has no antecedent. Again, we\u2019re left with a blank space where emotion should be.\n", "TV on the Radio_Seeds": "The cheap Williamsburg\u00a0loft that Tunde Adebimpe and Dave Sitek rented with day-job paychecks while making their first 4-track recordings is now an expensive condo with a wine shop built into it. TV on the Radio, the band that formed there with help from friends in other nearby noisy bands\u2014the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Liars\u2014make music that sounds a lot more expensive more than a decade later, but have otherwise moved more\u00a0toward accessibility than\u00a0away\u00a0from it. That\u2019s how music works differently from the market for the real estate where it\u2019s made: while Brooklyn\u2019s been gentrified into the walled-off backdrop for Lena Dunham\u2019s mumblecore Marlo Thomas performance, infinitely\u00a0more people will have access to TV on the Radio\u2019s fifth album\u00a0Seeds\u00a0than the band\u2019s 2004 Touch & Go debut, exactly\u00a0because\u00a0more money has been invested into it. Thankfully, for longtime fans and new listeners alike, though the music might sound pricier than ever,\u00a0the basic architecture hasn\u2019t really changed at all.\nOpening song \"Quartz\" demonstrates that from a production standpoint, the group hasn\u2019t lost its unique ability to conjure a surreal, soulful dread. Everything starts\u00a0in medias res, as if we\u2019ve been dropped into the middle of a s\u00e9ance in the desert. The handclaps, moaning vocals, and what sounds like a South Asian percussion instrument (it\u2019s\u00a0actually\u00a0a loop of Sitek dropping a drumstick onto piano strings) sound like a glossier version of \"Satellite\" and \"Staring at the Sun\" from 2003\u2019s\u00a0Young Liars\u00a0EP, Sitek and Adebimpe still merging lessons drawn from the European-derived NYC avant-garde and centuries of African-American church music. When Adebimpe\u2019s powerhouse vocal comes in, it\u2019s instantly familiar, both as a reminder of the absolute best that the shrunken state of post-millennial rock can produce and the fact that that voice\u2014that voice\u2014can still turn even the most interpersonal utterances into sentiments of galactic force.\nEven though it\u2019s meant to signify moving on from a romantic relationship, when Adebimpe keeps rolling out the phrase \"but I should really give it up sometime\" it\u2019s hard not to remember that the past several years for TV on the Radio\u2014as they came down from the impossible peak of Return to Cookie Mountain\u2014have been marked by different forms of loss. Most crucially, longtime bassist Gerard Smith passed away from cancer days after\u00a0Nine Types of Light\u00a0was released\u2014a huge blow for a tight-knit band. The group also broke from its label Interscope, which pushed\u00a0Mountain\u00a0in front of the largest possible audience (this is its first album on legendary '70s prog-rock haven Harvest). Light\u00a0also marked the point where TV on the Radio more or less stopped incorporating explicit politics in their lyrics\u2014observational and ironic message tracks like \"Caffeinated Consciousness\" and \"No Future Shock\" (\"do the \u2018no future\u2019\") felt like an extended \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af after the gospel-powered hopefulness of 2008\u2019s \"Golden Age\", which\u00a0for more than a few of us was the unofficial theme song of the sadly brief window of hope and change following Obama\u2019s inauguration.\nSo while TV on the Radio peaked from 2006 to 2008, the last two albums feel less like an artistic decline and more like a shift in focus and a lowering of stakes.\u00a0The lead single from\u00a0Seeds, accompanied by a video of Paul Reubens doing a\u00a0Speed Racer\u00a0knockoff, was \"Happy Idiot\", another song superficially about getting over a relationship that can easily double as an strategy for negotiating an existence over which one\u2019s lost all control. Like much of\u00a0Seeds\u00a0as well as its predecessor, \"Idiot\" embraces rhythms derived from the electronic end of the dance music spectrum, and does so as easily as they incorporated John Zorn skronk and Prince synth funk in the past. Like their best songs, \"Idiot\" works because it balances simple catchiness with urgency and anxiety, like their post-punk forebears taught them: the piston-pumping rhythm section is counterposed against Adebimpe\u2019s tenor, which floats in a dazed murmur for the vocals and upshifts to nervous falsetto for the chorus. This is a Sitek production, of course, and underneath the lustrous exterior he layers a subtle, high-pitched synth drone (a cousin to the menacing washes of distorted guitar that distinguished the band\u2019s early music), which gives the song a sense of creeping dread nearly at an unconscious level.\nAfter\u00a0Cookie Mountain, as with the followups to so many great records on which a restless band seeks to conquer new territory, Sitek started cleaning up the band\u2019s sound, doing away with its trademark siren-like clamor after\u00a0falling for\u00a0the pristine production of \"Eyes Without a Face\"\u00a0(listen to that song again and then come back to\u00a0Light and\u00a0Seeds. You\u2019ll hear them differently). What\u2019s quietly happened since then is that TV on the Radio have shed the Best Band in the World expectations and simply become a really good anthemic rock band. Check the segue from the neon sizzle of the Gary Numan/Depeche Mode burner \"Careful You\" into the open-hearted jangle boogie of \"Could You\", which achieves the ultra-rare feat of writing a '90s Sugar chorus as good as the ones Bob Mould came up with, or the perfectly-executed Ramones bop that introduces late-album track \"Lazerray\". It sounds simple, but shockingly few bands at TV on the Radio's level are able to do it without sounding corny. So while they've long segued from\u00a0fin-de-siecle Brooklyn to edge-of-the-continent Silver Lake, losing more than they\u2019ve gained along the way, TV on the Radio are still capable of conquering big stages and broad sonic territory with the kind of precision and power for which their\u00a0increasingly\u00a0desperate\u00a0older contemporaries need to rely on expensive stunts.\n", "TV on the Radio_Nine Types of Light": "On paper, TV on the Radio's recent accomplishments look like the work of textbook careerists. They left renowned indie label Touch and Go to join Interscope. Their major-label debut boasted a cameo from David Bowie. Singer Tunde Adebimpe starred opposite Anne Hathaway in a Jonathan Demme-directed drama. Guitarist/producer Dave Sitek made a record with Scarlett Johansson and is now possibly joining Jane's Addiction. Of course, one listen to any TV on the Radio album quickly dispels any notion of calculated opportunism. Even as their art-rock soul has blossomed out of their home-recording roots into something bigger and bolder, their music is still fraught with a simmering unease; even the dancefloor-ready maneuvers of 2008's Dear Science exuded a jittery, restless energy that was as tense as it was celebratory.\nHowever, as Nine Types of Light suggests, perhaps they just needed to get out of Brooklyn. The new album marks two significant changes in TVOTR's methodology: It was made in the wake of a one-year hiatus following six years of non-stop recording and touring; and it was recorded in Los Angeles, where Sitek has been steadily building his celebrity clientele list over the past few years. Both factors seem to have influenced the sound and feel of the album: Nine Types of Light is unquestionably TV on the Radio's most patient, positive recording to date, taking its cues as much from Dear Science's serene ballads (\"Family Tree\", \"Love Dog\") as its brassy workouts. Each of the band's albums has opted for a tone-setting opening salvo, and mission statements don't come more concise and clear-headed than Tunde Adebimpe's ecstatic, falsettoed hook on Nine Types' first song, \"Second Song\": \"Every lover on a mission/ Shift your known position/ Into the light.\"\nLove songs are, of course, nothing new for TV on the Radio, but they're usually cast against the grim backdrop of life during wartime: Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes' doo-wop serenade \"Ambulance\" spoke of emotional commitment using the language of hospital care; Return to Cookie Mountain's \"Province\" effectively equated a declaration of love with an act of radicalism. On Nine Types of Light, however, there seems to be a more concerted effort on the band's part to not let external pressures sully their inner spirit: Set to steady shuffle beats, \"Will Do\" and \"You\" are impassioned, open-hearted addresses delivered free of any political context, while Kyp Malone's \"Keep Your Heart\" feels like a riposte to Cookie Mountain's defeatist \"I was a lover before this war\" refrain, promising instead to \"keep your heart, if the world all falls apart.\" Malone's stutter-funk standout \"No Future Shock\" takes this don't-let-the-bastards-get-you-down sentiment to more delightfully absurd extremes, channeling pervasive anxieties over everything from global economic collapse to invasive airport security into a new dance move (\"Do the no future! Do the no future!\").\nComing four songs in, \"No Future Shock\" at first feels like an anomaly on an album that frontloads its more elegiac material; the notion that Nine Types is a more subdued, comedown counterpoint to Dear Science is further posited by Adebimpe's six-minute, mid-album centerpiece, \"Killer Crane\", a pretty, proggy pastorale that gently ebbs and flows with flourishes of strings, piano, banjo, and mellotron. But the album's second half is more in step with Dear Science's manic swagger; though mid-tempo exercises \"New Cannonball Blues\" and \"Forgotten\" never catch fire to the same degree (even with the late-song intrusion of the horn section), \"Repetition\" is an exhilarating display of Adibempe and Malone's motor-mouthed repartee set to a krautrock thrust. And as weird as it was to see Liars' Angus Andrew faithfully singing INXS' \"Guns in the Sky\" in a promo vid for Beck's Record Club last year, Nine Types' massive, arena-rattling closer, \"Caffeinated Consciousness\" proves that song must hold a special place in the hearts of Brooklyn's post-punk class of 2002.\nIn the past, TV on the Radio have tried to undercut their more rockist ambitions with dissonant textures and queasy atmospherics, or lace their prettiest ballads with subversively ominous lyrics. But Nine Types of Light shows how TV on the Radio's transmissions can be just as effective and affecting when delivered free of static and noise.\n", "TV on the Radio_Nine Types of Light (Deluxe Version)": "No Review", "TV on the Radio_Nine Types of Light (Deluxe)": "No Review", "TV on the Radio_Dear Science (Bonus Track Version)": "No Review", "TV on the Radio_Dear Science": "Dear Science, TV on the Radio's follow-up to 2006's Return to Cookie Mountain-- a dense and textural album with an optimistic core-- is catchier, but thornier than its predecessor. Musically, it's an instant grabber: Handclaps crack like fireworks. TVOTR's horns,\u00a0courtesy of the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra,\u00a0sound punchier and brighter than ever before. Vocalists Tunde Adebimpe and guitarist/singer Kyp Malone thrive as dual frontmen: They're sexy when they're angry, and even sexier when they're not. And\u00a0David Sitek's production is shiny and urgent, while his harsher synths and doo-dads hang back like a commentary track.\nBut\u00a0making popular music sits uneasily with this art-rock crew, and so although this is TV on the Radio's slickest, catchiest, and potentially most popular LP, it nevertheless reeks with dread. Lyrics about the dead, death, and dying litter the album from its second line onward. Songs with sentimental titles carry the most dire lyrics-- like \"Family Tree\", a gorgeous ballad about forbidden love whose titular plant becomes a gallows. And the lyrics to \"Red Dress\" are almost childishly pouty. Assuming the role of industry-bred stars, TVOTR complain that instead of waving collective fists in the air, listeners are merely getting down to their Prince-like guitars and brash brass: \"They got you tamed, and they got me tamed.\" But the self-hatred makes it engaging: \"I'm living a life not worth dying for.\"\nThe promise of dancing away all your troubles hangs over every sweaty note, until TVOTR happily yank it away. On \"Dancing Choose\", the big chorus and synth power-chords interrupt the funk and double-time vocals to remind us this is a rock band, prone to making big statements. See also \"DLZ\", a half-rap, half-primal scream from Adebimpe that sounds like it's aimed at every figure of power in the world. But how do they follow that? With a big brash song about fucking. Anthemic horns and parade drums treat the whole thing like a football pep rally, \"I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna shake you, I'm gonna make you cum.\" That could be their most transparent lyric yet.\n\"Shout Me Out\" is the only cut that reveals any unselfconscious joy. With a chorus that borrows well from Bob Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\", it comes the closest to the raw sound of their past works: Repetitive guitar and a chiming synth loop introduce Adebimpe singing a gentle verse, as the song builds to a fantastic, frenetic release and the electric guitar crackles and rails along.\u00a0This is familiar territory for them-- and\u00a0they get out fast.\nYes, this is shit-hot thrilling music. But it's also brainy and ambivalent, and more engaging for it. TV on the Radio remain a true Event Band, and the sign o' the times they capture here isn't audacious hope, or fierce revolution: it's confusion. They're the house band for a country that has no idea what'll hit it next, and Dear Science is a jagged landscape of self-doubt, Bush-hate, and future-fear. And once in a while, you still get some of their optimism.\u00a0Take the first single and the album's fulcrum, \"Golden Age\", which ice skates to heaven on billowing horns, sweet swirling strings, a video that stars harmless dancing cops, and Malone's falsetto. Malone has said it's about \"utopia.\" And he sings like he still believes in it. But he has nothing to back him up but the beat.\n", "TV on the Radio_Return To Cookie Mountain": "Often when we say a record has \"atmosphere,\" we mean it as a put-down. From Sgt. Pepper's to the present, a record's sonic appeal-- the effects, the mood, the spaces between the notes-- is inextricable from how it hits us. But when an artist pushes atmosphere in place of songs, it's frequently thought of as a crutch. Most listeners don't trust a mood to grab their hearts the way they trust, say, a human voice; nobody counts on production to deliver the \"money note.\"\nWhen I try to explain TV on the Radio to people who aren't into them, the first thing on the checklist is singer Tunde Adebimpe, a stoic romantic who falters but never whimpers. He's got about the best set of pipes in indie rock, yet on Return to Cookie Mountain his greatest strength lies in how well he stands back and blends in-- with the throatier Kyp Malone, guest singers including David Bowie, and, especially, with the atmosphere evoked by producer and noisemaker David Sitek. As the two founding members, Adebimpe and Sitek fit together like Jagger and Richards. But where the two Rolling Stones projected snarling sex, these guys express... what?\nIn the original version of Return to Cookie Mountain that leaked this spring-- the one that kicked off at full throttle with \"Wolf Like Me\"-- they sounded like victory. With that cut up front, you knew this was the great leap forward for which their last two records paved the way-- and when I say three records, I'm counting their scattershot sketchbook OK Calculator, which caught the band at its most \"Hey, what can I do with this four-track?\" They always claim they'd rather keep messing around with new ideas than settle down and crank out the hits that are at their fingertips, which is one reason 2004's Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes felt more eclectic than excellent. (In retrospect, the other reason is that they were still using drum machines.) But this time, maybe they'd changed their minds.\nBut before Return to Cookie Mountain became their major label debut, its tracklist was reshuffled. Now it leads off with the fascinating \"I Was a Lover\", a sympathy card that carries the most emotional sample on the record-- a bellow like the sound of a sad elephant, which fits right in with the defeated verse. It takes skill to craft a tone that people can feel sorry for; maybe there is a money note locked in that pedal crouching under Sitek's shoe. But other times, the noise evokes an orchestra, or a rockslide. Abstract and electronic textures roll over acoustic sources-- bowed upright bass, sitars, flutes, backward wind chimes-- to reach a perfect consistency, all the way through to the closer, \"Wash the Day Away\", where white noise rises and swallows them all. But not a moment too soon: not only is the mix stellar (if a little too biased away from the vocals), but once you get used to the new setlist, the pacing is perfect as well.\nThe band cycles up like a centrifuge. Vocals spin on \"Dirty Whirl\" like wooden figurines on a Swiss cuckoo clock, while a shimmering piano figure chimes across \"Province\". Like their first albums, the songs build on loops, grooves, and drones. They feel familiar, but they've never sounded this good-- or this thick. Even the voices cascade on top of each other, which obscures much of the lyrics. Nothing can cut through except the sharp and vigorous rhythm section. Check out the way the air catches in Adebimpe's throat on \"A Method\", then shakes loose when Jaleel Bunton bursts in like a drum corps waiting in the parking lot for the parade to start.\nBut what's their message? They're not here to rock-- they use too many loops, too much repetition, and too little chaos. They can do the community-drum-circle thing, but they're too slick to try it more than once (\"Let the Devil In\"). And even Adebimpe's voice has never sunk this far into the music; we don't even get an a capella feature this time, because this isn't an album about standing out. He's still a failed romantic, a social conscience, a charmer, and a distant voyeur; but with every album he becomes less of a \"persona\" and more of a regular person.\nMaybe that's why this album has such an incredible pull: It doesn't make an atmosphere so much as a space to spend time in, and Adebimpe doesn't become a narrator so much as a witness. We sidle up into his head and watch through his eyes the tyrants, the druggies, the cocky lovers, the losers, and those beautiful fools who still surrender to lines like \"Love is the province of the brave.\" And TV on the Radio are standing in the center, watching it all go by again, and again, and again.\n", "TV on the Radio_Desperate Youth": "The word I keep hearing for this band is \"soulless.\" It's true that the Young Liars EP had a metallic sheen, a mechanical repetitiveness that both boosted and encased the silver-throated vocals of Tunde Adebimpe. The songs were full of distance and voyeurism, as if Adebimpe was stuck on his own satellite, watching lovers from afar. When he got close to a woman, on the stunning soliloquy \"Blind\", he couldn't close the deal without giving up the truth: \"My love is a suckerbet.\" But that ain't soulless.\nAnother description that never rang true was the comparison of Adebimpe's voice to Peter Gabriel-- a decent match in timbre, but Adebimpe's such a different person that I just can't hear the likeness. This isn't a man who would go on stage dressed like a flower. Instead, Adebimpe sounds like a superhero-- a troubled, Batman-style superhero, who can rescue the girl but frets over whether to take the grateful French kiss when they hit safe ground. Nobody with his talents and forthrightness could also have insecurities, yet that was what the lyrics made us believe. His vocals resonate because of his identity: He towers over most vocalists, not just for his skill, but because he's so transparent behind it.\nThe band's full-length debut may be one of the most eagerly awaited records of the year. Until now, TV on the Radio have only flashed their talent: David Andrew Sitek's chugging beats and harsh grey textures, Adebimpe's voice, and new member Kyp Malone on vocals, guitar, and even more loops. So the final product, Desperate Youths, Blood Thirsty Babes, can't help but sound like a curveball when held against the flawless Young Liars, the monumental expectations, and the fact that they're still indulging their growing pains.\nThe record starts strong: On opener \"The Wrong Way\", the sound of a sidewalk sax blower is interrupted off the beat by a dark chugging loop, a sound that resembles refrigerators being pushed down a hole-- but also resembles human feet stomping and hands clapping. Funk and gospel enter the palette as Malone and Adebimpe harmonize on lyrics that grapple with race. TV on the Radio don't base their work on the fact that they're an interracial, mainly African-American band; unlike Living Colour or the 2 Tone bands in the 80s, there's no reason to peg them as a \"black rock band\" more than a rock band that happens to have black members. So when race comes up, they use it for questions more than statements. On \"The Wrong Way\", they pick up and dismiss a series of black icons and stereotypes, from the \"soft shoe\" entertainer or the gentle \"magic nigger\" in the movies, to the \"fist up\" protesters and \"new negro politician\"; but they're also trying out the roles, as if assessing where they stand or questioning whether they could end up \"playin' the whore.\" If they have a message, it's mostly about themselves: TV on the Radio reflect the world they're in, but they'll never say they speak for it.\nThe album repeats one track from the EP, \"Staring at the Sun\"-- the catchiest but least introspective track on that album-- and that sets the path for the band's new style, which is alternately driving and repetitious. The guitar parts are almost as static as the beats, and no track develops with the subtlety of, say, Young Liars' \"Blind\". The loops and settings run out of ideas by the end of the record; \"Don't Love You\" chugs ahead with no progress, making the next song, \"Bomb Yourself\", sound more plodding than it actually is. Even \"Wear You Out\" seems limited when the swarthy opening picks up horns, and then plateaus right away. It isn't a climax so much as proof of how cold those textures can become.\nThe last third is a tough slog. But track by track, the album's songwriting is tight and often beautiful, like the harmonies on \"King Eternal\" and \"Poppy\" that scrape the sky and even overshadow the graceful a cappella \"Ambulance\". And the lyrics are exceptional, with not-too-cryptic images that are both surreal and frank: \"All men condemned by men to die/ Damned by blind bitch in hallowed halls\" is an intriguing image of the justice system, but to follow it with \"Cover your balls/ 'Cause we swing kung fu\" is truly the way to greatness.\nThe biggest improvement here is the addition of Malone. Is it even right for one band to hog two great vocalists, two singers with real personalities and no stylistic self-caging, at a time when most people just struggle to follow a template? Malone creeps through the high registers and whispers the heat that Adebimpe won't release; the two of them sound great as co-leads. My only objection is that the record sounds less intimate than when Adebimpe has the mike to himself.\nThe Young Liars EP was as fully realized as all the critics suggested, yet now, TV on the Radio sound like a work in progress. Still, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes shows more strengths than mistakes. The band's best work comes out of tension, out of a dramatic setting or the sparking of elements against each other-- multi-cultures smashed together, men harnessing their voices to machines, the excitement of that saxophone cutting against a sludge-loop at the start of the record. They wrestle with these tensions instead of letting them explode, they hammer out loops and sounds as they collaborate on music that's rent with conflict. Nobody knows where it'll end, but we're lucky to get to watch.\n", "TV on the Radio_Blood Thirsty Babes": "The word I keep hearing for this band is \"soulless.\" It's true that the Young Liars EP had a metallic sheen, a mechanical repetitiveness that both boosted and encased the silver-throated vocals of Tunde Adebimpe.

Still, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes shows more strengths than mistakes. The band's best work comes out of tension, out of a dramatic setting or the sparking of elements against each other-- multi-cultures smashed together, men harnessing their voices to machines, the excitement of that saxophone cutting against a sludge-loop at the start of the record. They wrestle with these tensions instead of letting them explode, they hammer out loops and sounds as they collaborate on music that's rent with conflict. Nobody knows where it'll end, but we're lucky to get to watch.\n", "Coldplay_World War Joy (Japan Edition)": "No Review", "Coldplay_World War Joy": "No Review", "Coldplay_Sick Boy (Special Edition)": "No Review", "Coldplay_Sick Boy": "No Review", "Coldplay_Memories...Do Not Open": "No Review", "Coldplay_The Chainsmokers- Japan Special Edition": "No Review", "Deafheaven_Ordinary Corrupt Human Love": "Deafheaven\u2019s music is not made for the everyday. No two of their four records sound quite alike, but their mood is immediately identifiable. It\u2019s a place where serious subjects\u2014love and loss, emotional apocalypse, existence\u2014are amplified like sunlight through a magnifying glass. They make a kaleidoscope out of heavy music\u2019s most introspective corners: The tortured shrieks and blast beats of black metal ripple through shoegaze\u2019s immersive guitar tones, all building with the skyward patience of starry-eyed post-rock. You don\u2019t put these records on casually.\nGiven their penchant for grand gestures, the most extreme thing about Ordinary Corrupt Human Love is how subdued it sounds. It\u2019s the first release from the Los Angeles-based quintet that feels more like a collection of songs than one unbroken piece, and it exposes shades of their work that have primarily been kept to the peripheries. The slow, dramatic opener \u201cYou Without End\u201d blooms from muted piano and slide guitar, instruments that lend a mournful touch to their typically explosive melodies. Other songs incorporate clean singing in contrast to vocalist George Clarke\u2019s characteristic howl. \u201cNight People,\u201d with lead vocals from goth-folk singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe and multi-instrumentalist Ben Chisholm, is their most spectral and fragile recording to date. This music suggests devastation without placing you at the center of it.\nOver the past few years, Deafheaven have discussed hitting various personal lows in the wake of 2015\u2019s restless and intense New Bermuda, citing depression, creative fatigue, and substance abuse. Bassist Stephen Clark quit the band once the tour was over. Guitarist Kerry McCoy got sober. Taking a more metaphorical refuge, Clarke became interested in candid photography, collaborating with artist Nick Steinhardt to create stark portraits like Sean Stout\u2019s photograph that graces Human Love\u2019s cover. \u201cI told him I didn\u2019t want anything extraordinary,\u201d he explained about the collaborative visual project. \u201cJust people in their everyday routine.\u201d\nThis shift in perspective, from the vast to the ordinary, is the point. On Human Love, Deafheaven tell unglamorous stories, examining intimate scenes that go down when no one is watching. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to stay sad\u201d goes an early lyric, and the record follows suit, as dark moods roll by like faraway clouds. Clarke\u2019s piercing voice continues to evoke the highest reaches of human pain, yet he\u2019s grown more adept at exposing subtler melancholy. In the surging, dreamlike \u201cHoneycomb,\u201d he writes like a goth beat poet surveying the city: Words like \u201cgeese,\u201d \u201cmariachi,\u201d and \u201cCort\u00e1zar\u201d have never been sung with such brutality.\nThe band matches Clarke in all his passing visions. They\u2019ve become as expressive in their slowcore balladry (\u201cNear\u201d) as their more bracing epics (the duel-guitar-laden second half of \u201cWorthless Animal\u201d). Their best songs, like centerpiece \u201cCanary Yellow,\u201d explore all these various modes in ragged, epiphanic cycles. While peers like Sannhet have grown more airtight with each new album, Deafheaven still love letting their seams show: Drop the needle at any point on Human Love, and you might hear a completely different band\u2014one aiming for arenas, or mosh pits, or the soundtrack of a climactic makeout scene in a prestige television show. Five years removed from their landmark Sunbather, Deafheaven have never seemed less interested in being fashionable\u2014as a result, they sound newly content.\nIn its hour-long runtime, Human Love unfolds as an even-handed showing of Deafheaven\u2019s strengths. Like Sunbather and New Bermuda, it\u2019s marked by fleeting moments of sheer beauty. Many of these arrive thanks to McCoy\u2019s guitar playing, a direct and intuitive line of communication that complements Clarke\u2019s illegible emotion. Some of his best riffs are scattered throughout \u201cGlint,\u201d a song that evolves magnificently as Clarke intertwines visions of marital bliss with fantasies of self-destruction. It\u2019s an instant addition to their canon of showstoppers, walking the tightrope of extreme music and radio-friendly \u201990s alt-rock without sinking into the cheesy, histrionic center of that Venn diagram. That they sound less interested in risking that fate only makes their successes feel more triumphant.\nThere have always been two ways to hear Deafheaven\u2019s music. There\u2019s the micro approach, which involves dissecting the band\u2019s influences and navigating their records like a mixtape without a tracklist. (What\u2019s that familiar melody? What emotion are they trying to express? What genre is this?) On Human Love, they recall the atmospheres of a wide variety of bands without explicitly copping their styles: Touchstones like Slowdive, the Smashing Pumpkins, and the Smiths are all suggested at various points within this music. Like watching a magic show backstage, looking for these references can draw admiration as much as disillusionment at how it all comes together.\nThe other angle to admire Deafheaven is more macro\u2014which particularly benefits this album\u2014as you stand back and surrender to the squall. Human Love is Deafheaven\u2019s subtlest, prettiest music, and it aims for a different kind of transcendence. For all the influences their music conjures, you\u2019d never mistake these songs for any other band. The record\u2019s title is taken from Graham Greene\u2019s 1951 novel The End of the Affair, words spoken by a narrator who is uncommonly torn between love and hate. In the place of his all-consuming obsessions, he longs for something benign and ignorable to ponder on the way to work\u2014the type of fantasies he imagines occupying the mind of more contented people. It\u2019s a common dream, though, for some of us, it\u2019s unrealistic. Human Love thrives in the moments where the extraordinary and the commonplace collide and become indistinguishable. In search of something quietly universal, Deafheaven can\u2019t help but notice the tiny miracle in each breath.\n", "Deafheaven_New Bermuda": "Nothing about the band Deafheaven makes literal sense, starting with their place in the world. They are a black metal-ish band, but black metal fans either hate them or engage in constant, spirited discussions about why they don't. Their breakout, 2013\u2019s Sunbather, took basic notions about black metal and shoegaze from their first album Roads to Judah and airlifted them into a rarefied emotional realm where track lengths dissolved into the whole along with straightforward interpretations: George Clarke\u2019s lyrics compressed earthbound experiences\u2014depression, material envy, struggles for purpose\u2014 into wild, leaping abstractions about love, oceans of light, tears. This was music that yearned palpably to leap across distances, closing gaps like a firing synapse.\nNew Bermuda, if anything, is more overwhelming than Sunbather. The roiling peaks of that album\u2014say, \u201cDreamhouse\u201d or \"The Pecan Tree\u201d\u2014are the resting temperature of this one. They have shaped a suite of songs into one pliable and massive 47-minute arc, one that is as easy to separate into distinct quadrants as the stream from a fire hydrant. Clarke still screams euphoniously, leaning into long vowel sounds and open tones so that phrases like \u201con the smokey tin it melts again and again\u201d function as color more than as thought. (You could never discern the words without the aid of a lyric sheet, anyway.) They are a band that works best in colors, as the titles of the albums and the salmon color of Sunbather\u2019s cover attest: On New Bermuda, they revisit an ecstatic sound world that resembles, as Clarke puts it on opening song \u201cBrought to the Water\u201d, \u201ca multiverse of fuchsia and light.\u201d\nHaving discovered this multiverse,\u00a0New Bermuda finds them shaping it. The album is shorter and more compressed than Sunbather, and doesn\u2019t telescope into \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d sections quite as clearly. There is still a nauseous sort of beauty to their chord voicings: the lurches into minor key on \u201cLuna\u201d feel as heavy as their swings back into major, like the motion of a great, creaking iron gate. The second half of the \u201cfuchsia and light\u201d lyric is \"surrenders to blackness now,\u201d and if Deafheaven\u2019s music at its best represents a brilliant collision of beauty and despair, the battle feels pitched at higher stakes than it did on Sunbather. Clarke\u2019s voice is sharper and mixed lower, clawing at the smooth walls of the music like something wretched trying to escape a pit.\nThe lyrics suggest that this confining space might resemble the sort of manicured suburban prison that Sunbather was set inside: \"There is no ocean for me. There is no glamour. Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt. I gaze at it from the oven of my home. Confined to a house that never remains clean,\u201d runs a passage from \u201cLuna\u201d. But listening to Deafheaven, you don\u2019t feel the particulars of this dilemma any more than you notice the pebbles of a gravel driveway from the window of an airplane. The music acts as an incinerator for any malaise you bring to it. It is a warm blur of noise, and fans of many different kinds of moody sensual guitar musics can close their eyes and place themselves inside it: If you have at any point worn a Deftones, Cure, My Bloody Valentine, or an Explosions in the Sky t-shirt, there is room for you inside here.\nBut Deafheaven reach further and further on this album: The drowsily sliding guitars on the long coda to \u201cCome Back\u201d conjure the easy warmth of Built to Spill. An organ wells up as the guitars fade, like something Ira Kaplan would do on a Yo La Tengo record. The thick palm-muted chugging on the beginning of \u201cLuna\u201d is reminiscent of the Slayer of Seasons of the Abyss. The undistorted downstrokes on \u201cGifts for the Earth\u201d are a visitation from Joy Division, while the flagrant wah-pedal abusing guitar solo on \u201cBaby Blue\u201d is pure Load-era Kirk Hammett.\nAll of these references, which bring together many bands that wouldn\u2019t normally have much to do with one another, points to something dreamlike and uncanny in Deafheaven\u2019s grand sound. At a moment when guitar-centric music feels less central to the conversation, and great indie-rock bands have retreated into hardy local scenes, Deafheaven play like a beautiful, abstracted dream of guitar music's transportive power. The year's most jolting guitar-centered rock records have reimagined the guitar's place in the constellation slightly\u2014on Tame Impala\u2019s Currents, the guitar glimmers distantly at us from beneath a glass, darkly\u2014a distant shape moving beneath the larger, more legible shapes of the compressed drums and programmed synths. On Kurt Vile\u2019s b\u2019lieve i\u2019m going down, it is part of a general out-of-time way of life, a devotion to anachronism and lived-in symbols that keeps the confusion of the outside world at bay.\nDeafheaven, meanwhile, unabashedly treat the roar of electric guitars as a holy experience. But they have earned their sense of awe, and you can see audiences returning it tenfold in their live performances. The transcendence their music gazes towards has a long spiritual lineage. To wit: I pulled my earbuds out while listening to New Bermuda this morning in a store where Boston's \"More Than A Feeling\" was playing. The transition was seamless. They were aiming at the same horizon spot, made for the moment when you begin dreaming.\n", "Deafheaven_Sunbather": "Deafheaven weren't always this good. The San Francisco band's early shows found a scrappy, ambitious bunch of punk kids trying to warp black metal with shoegaze in a way that, for all its advances, felt familiar. In late 2010, they signed to Deathwish, the label run by Converge's Jacob Bannon, and there were expectations in the underground. (Though, at that time, people seemed to focus more on the fact that they didn't look like a metal band than what they were creating.) When vocalist George Clarke and songwriter/guitarist Kerry McCoy released their debut LP, Roads to Judah, in 2011, they added wrinkles to that live sound, especially on the opening track, \"Violet\". The collection didn't always match those standards. It sometimes felt muddled, like they were trying to squeeze too much into the frame.\nBut that gorgeous 12-minute set-piece established the template and scope for the band's excellent sophomore album, Sunbather, a record that finds Deafheaven living up to and then surpassing expectations. Basically, they've learned how to take the sounds they've dreamed up out of their heads so we can hear them, too. If you go back and listen to Roads, you'll find the elements that appear on Sunbather with 10 times the intensity.\u00a0So while the approach here\u00a0 isn't a surprise, the force with which Deafheaven pulls it off is a revelation.\nSunbather's a seven-song collection that fuses into a massive 60-minute piece. The sequencing, moving from brightness to darkness and back, is brilliant. Throughout, McCoy gives in to his inner Johnny Marr, offering deeper, prettier, more eclectic guitar tones. His lines are smeary with tremolo and delay, and the band seamlessly incorporates melancholic piano, harsh Godflesh-style noise bursts, spoken word, lush acoustic strums, and eerie samples. That, and new drummer Daniel Tracy plays big, adding a wallop they've missed in the past. (Deafheaven have always been Clarke and McCoy with a shifting lineup around them; let's hope this one lasts.)\nThis is music that inspires the kind of wide-screen feelings people look for in Sigur R\u00f3s, Mogwai (who Deafheaven have covered), or Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Words of anger and frustration collide with the sheer beauty of the music. The power of that blend-- raw black metal and hardcore basking in pastel-colored post-rock guitars-- is something you don't experience in those other groups. There are plaintive moments here, but this is largely music about romantic lust, anger, and disappointment delivered by a band who know their punk and hardcore as well as their metal. They know their Cure and the Smiths, too. Remember the ecstatic closing moments of Fuck Buttons' \"Sweet Love for Planet Earth\"? Loop that and ask Explosions in the Sky to play the accompanying music and you're tapping into this sound.\nWhile Deafheaven push this epic music as far as it can go, they retain a central emotional core, and are always in control compositionally. The opening song, \"Dream House\", is over nine minutes long; the closer, \"The Pecan Tree\", which moves from dire black metal to triumphant post-rock without any stitches showing, is closer to 12. The four longer songs don't repeat themselves; each is stunning in its constant motion and variation. \"Sunbather\" is bleaker than \"Dream House\", for instance, and on \"Vertigo\", they downshift from gossamer prettiness to full-on heavy with a warped My Bloody Valentine transition followed by their most power metal guitar soloing to date. At the five-minute mark of that song, blast beats enter and it goes black metal. Two minutes later, though, it's soaring again with hook-laden guitars and floor-punching dynamics.\nEven the interstitial parts inspire. \"Dream House\"'s delicate closing arpeggios blend with \"Irresistible\",\u00a0 a three-minute swatch of melancholic guitar and piano that works as a gentle pause before the massive \"Sunbather\", but is in of itself a gorgeous composition. The grinding industrial noise at the end of \"Sunbather\" dissolves into \"Please Remember\", a relatively brief piece that features Alcest's Neige speaking lines from Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. (Clarke explained its inclusion in a recent Show No Mercy: \"That passage is really important to me. It just screams insecurity, which I have huge faults with.\")\nClarke's voice mixed with the mountains of cascading guitars and drum crescendos is so strong that you don't need to know what he's saying to feel the effect of the music. But if you do decide to read the lyrics, you won't be disappointed: Sunbather was in part inspired by the singer growing up with his mother and brother without any money and wondering what it'd be like to have it. There's also his realization that, like his largely absent father, he's able to be cold emotionally, and not necessary able to love. The album's central image is of a girl sunbathing outside of her upscale house. Clarke spotted her after moving back home for a bit and while stuck in an existential crisis. He wondered what he'd end up doing himself and, more so, what it would be like to have that girl's existence. And, of course, what it would be like to have that girl. \"Dream House\" ends with a dialogue Clarke says he pieced together from drunken texts between him and a woman he was crazy about: \"'I'm dying.'/ 'Is it blissful?'/ 'It's like a dream.'/ 'I want to dream.'\"\nWith Sunbather, Deafheaven have made one of the biggest albums of the year, one that impresses you with its scale, the way Swans' The Seer did last year. Like M. Gira's masterpiece, it has the ability to capture the attention of people who don't normally listen to heavy music.\u00a0It's also one of the most successful examples of a band using black metal as a starting point and ending up somewhere else entirely. People cite the short-lived San Francisco band Weakling's seminal 2000 album Dead as Dreams as the pinnacle of American black metal; Sunbather is another. Like Weakling, Deafheaven have changed things with this record-- black metal won't be the same now that it's been released. Of course, folks will argue over just how black metal-- or even metal-- Sunbather is, and will discuss the \"un-metal\" pink cover art and the fact that Clarke could probably be a J. Crew model. These kinds of arguments are irrelevant. Instead, try focusing on how much better Sunbather is than any other black metal album released this year, and how it's, by far, one of the best in any genre. Or, maybe, just talk to your friends about what it feels like to listen to a modern classic.\n", "Deafheaven_Roads to Judah": "No Review", "Adele_25": "Adele is only 27 years old, still young by any sensible metric, but much of 25, her third album, concerns itself with the passage of time: the inevitable accumulation of both years and vantages. It\u2019s as if she knows intimately the nauseating experience of waking up one morning, surveying a half-lived life, and thinking, \"Oops.\" She\u00a0never adopts a schoolmarm\u2019s consternation (and she is entitled to some authority, having sold a boggling 30 million copies of her last record, 2011\u2019s\u00a021), but she is nevertheless cautionary, encouraging her listeners to do better, act faster, stop being such a bunch of clowns. Get up and get over, friend, she seems to be saying\u2014you are a grown person now.\nOr: \"We both know we ain\u2019t kids no more,\" which is how she puts it on \"Send My Love (To Your New Lover)\", a song co-written by Max Martin, the 44-year-old Swedish super-producer who has now penned almost as many number one singles as Lennon and McCartney. Stack \u2018em up, and all of Martin\u2019s songs follow a particular formula: they\u2019re prickly, quick-moving affairs that braid the precision of Swedish pop like ABBA with the more groove-oriented rhythms of American R&B. To that end, Martin is as exacting of a songwriter as I\u2019ve ever heard: like he did with the tracks he made for Taylor Swift (\"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Style\") and Katy Perry (\"I Kissed a Girl\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Roar\"), he relies on some enigmatic internal cadence, clipping syllables like a hiccuping\u00a0poet, taking a tiny scalpel to his melodies. He keeps his lines pointy and balanced. \"Send-my-love/ To-your-new/ Luh-uh-ver.\"\u00a0The results are like encountering a person with perfectly symmetrical features\u2014both instantly appealing and deeply, existentially unsettling. The song opens with carefully plucked acoustic guitar, and when the chorus comes in it\u2019s as if someone yanked the curtains up on a dark room.\nLyrically, Adele leans on a familiar kind of outrage, reckoning with a lover who broke every promise he ever made to her. There's unrequited love, but then there\u2019s love that changes shape; if you\u2019re unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of that transaction\u2014made unwilling witness to the mysterious, alchemical shift in which devotion suddenly thins, sours\u2014true understanding is impossible, a fool\u2019s errand. This is the love that Adele sings of, the kind where there\u2019s nothing left to do but resign: \"I\u2019m giving you up, I\u2019m forgiving it all.\" Nurturing grudges is a young woman\u2019s game.\nAlmost every song on 25\u00a0addresses heartache in one form or another. \"Send My Love\" is anomalous in its confidence; more often, Adele sounds excruciatingly aware of her own blunders and bereavements, and the ways in which time has made them indelible.\u00a0Sometimes, Adele herself is the agent of grief, like on \"Hello\", in which she attempts to reach an ex-lover on her flip-phone. Surely, on some level, Adele knows the message she\u2019s so hungry to deliver\u2014\"I\u2019m sorry/ For breaking your heart\"\u2014is not the kind of sentiment that\u2019s going to yield her much more than a slowly raised middle finger (the indignation of the recently forsaken is vast, merciless). She is arguably more desperate to reach an earlier iteration of herself, to correct something, quiet some panic.\nOther times she is a victim of loss. In the piano ballad \"When We Were Young\", which was co-written with Tobias Jesso Jr., she sings: \"Let me photograph you in this light/ In case it is the last time/ That we might be exactly like we were/ Before we realized.\" The instrumentation swells, quiets. The precise nature of that realization is not named, but of course it doesn\u2019t need to be, or not explicitly (as Joan Didion wrote, in 1967, \"It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends.\"). The song itself is a kind of homage to the booming, soft-focus singer-songwriters who dominated AM radio in the 1970s (Barbra Streisand, Shirley Bassey), and Adele\u2019s vocal performance is astonishing, full of vigor and beauty.\nStill: the cumulative effect is sometimes as treacly as the heavily frosted sheet cake being slid onto the buffet table in the carpeted banquet hall where this song will be blasting, on a loop, for all of eternity. Even your most adorable aunt\u2014the one who loves a Yankee Candle\u2014will eventually drain her flute of sparkling wine, lean forward, and be like, \"Dog, this shit is corny.\"\nTaken as a whole document, it is truly staggering how many of these songs\u2014all of them, as far as I can tell\u2014address the foibles of romantic love. It\u2019s not so much that Adele\u2019s lyrics are platitudinous (although they often are), it\u2019s that the album\u2019s prevailing sentiment eventually becomes wearying. In his book The Song Machine, John Seabrook interviews Bonnie McKee, the 31-year-old songwriter behind some of Katy Perry\u2019s bigger hits and a frequent collaborator of Martin\u2019s; McKee offers a pat, sorry-dude response to the question of lyrical uniformity in contemporary pop. \"Most people still just want to hear about love and partying,\" is what she tells Seabrook. A shrug\u2014a \"Hey, it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you! You dummies are the ones who want that!\"\u2014is implied.\nPerhaps that is what people want: Adele is presently on track to break N*Sync's record, held since 2000, of 2.24 million copies sold in the first week of release (on Friday, more than 900,000 people downloaded 25 from the iTunes store alone). And perhaps these songs are trifles, foregone conclusions that, instead of facilitating or inviting a deepening, allow for just one outcome: a peaceable head-bob, a wistful smile. They are one-way, dead-end roads, emotional shortcuts to wells of loss and contrition. But regardless of how one might feel about the spiritual utility of pop music, Adele\u2019s instincts as a singer remain unmatched; she is, inarguably, the greatest vocalist of her generation, an artist who instinctively understands timbre and pitch, when to let some air in. It does not seem unfair to ask that dynamism of her songs, too.\n", "Adele_21": "No Review", "Adele_19": "No Review", "Chairlift_Moth": "Moths seem like an error in evolution. Instead of morphing into the bright symmetry of a butterfly, a caterpillar becomes a dull and monochromatic flicker, flying in meaningless orbits around a light source and sometimes annihilating itself in it. There\u2019s something familiar in this pattern, though; it resembles something as exposed and human as falling in love. \"We liked the idea of the moth as a metaphor for vulnerability,\" Caroline Polachek of Chairlift said in an interview with Pitchfork last year. \"There are risks everywhere, but it doesn\u2019t question them.\"\n\"Crying in Public,\" one of the advance singles from the duo\u2019s new album, Moth, is about being so overwhelmed with emotion, with the feeling of falling in love, that the narrator starts crying on the train. \"Each autumn leaf and passing breath,\" Polachek sings. \"Each antidote to sudden death.\"\u00a0The song captures the near-panicky edge to this feeling, the moment your environment becomes so charged with possibility you find yourself noticing everything: birds, breakdancers, light pouring in through trees. It's too much, and its too-muchness makes you feel small, like an exposed nerve in a vast world. On Moth, Polachek and her bandmate Patrick Wimberly aim to embrace this too-muchness, expanding their sound and opening themselves up, and the result is the indie pop band\u2019s most emotionally generous and consistent effort yet.\n\"Crying in Public\" is the song on Moth that most resembles their earlier work, a kind of flowing and gelatinous synth pop that feels dense and enveloping, the texture of feeling itself.\u00a0It seems related to the buoyancy of \"Bruises,\" from their debut, or to \"I Belong in Your Arms,\" from 2012\u2019s Something, but while those records described the cellular rush of love, \"Crying\" describes love\u2019s ability to gently create inner and outer space. There\u2019s also a groove buried in the texture of the song, a kind of irregular flutter at its center, as if Chairlift are deliberately trying to simulate heart arrhythmia.\nIt\u2019s in this often-fidgety percussion that Moth distinguishes itself from Chairlift\u2019s other records. Sometimes it feels as if the drums were sketched out first and the songs built organically around them. Lead single \"Ch-Ching\" forms itself explicitly around handclaps alternating with glassy and brittle drums. It\u2019s both animated and oddly inflexible, and the effect is disconcerting, like watching a skeleton learn how to walk. \"Show U Off\" inherits its groove from Busta Rhymes\u2019 \"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See\" and fills its blank spaces in with nervous post-disco guitar.\nSometimes this instability intensifies their compositions. Closer \"No Such Thing as Illusion\" feels so empty that it sort of works like an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, its pockets of nothing enhancing the something. \"Polymorphing\" evolves through at least three different arrangements. The horn charts are possibly the most striking feature of the record; saxophones unreel in trembling ribbons or sprout from the songs in abrupt, harmonic blooms.\u00a0It\u2019s only when Moth\u00a0loses this tailored sense of groove that it starts to feel shapeless; \"Ottawa to Osaka\" melts in and out of coherence, and \"Unfinished Business\" is only motivated by an irregular, clustering snare and Polachek\u2019s vocal, which approaches notes as if they were mapped coordinates.\nSometimes the arrangements verge on fussy; there\u2019s an airless quality to \"Romeo,\" which is both distracting and appropriate, as the song\u2019s about running, exhaling instead of inhaling. Polachek sings from the perspective of Atalanta, an elusive character from Greek mythology, and the drums underpinning the song give it the rhythm of one of Atalanta\u2019s footraces, to which she would challenge her potential suitors in order to avoid marriage. \"I\u2019m going to run/ \u2018Til you give me a reason to stop/ To fall on my knees,\" Polachek sings, as if challenging someone to surprise her, as if she\u2019s allowing herself the capacity for surprise.\nFor all of these tics and irregularities, Moth is overall Chairlift's best and smoothest long-player statement. As much as the singles on Something thrilled, it struggled for coherence from song to song. The songs on Moth feel related and extroverted, pulled together by a common purpose. They have a charming asymmetry, they drift in sometimes oblique and irregular patterns. This is pop that wants to show you what it\u2019s made of.\n", "Chairlift_Chairlift at 6:15": "No Review", "Chairlift_Something": "\nChairlift's second full-length,\u00a0Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer Caroline Polachek has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and Polachek has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic relationships and the evolution of character.\nOf course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit\u00a0\"Bruises\" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member Aaron Pfenning split with the group after his romantic relationship with Polachek ended. (He now has an atmospheric disco project called\u00a0Rewards.) Now a duo, Polachek and multi-instrumentalist Patrick Wimberly have a different chemistry.\u00a0Wimberly, a producer on several\u00a0Das Racist tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits Polachek's voice and melodies. As a result,\u00a0Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.\nPolachek's presence fades when the music gets too inert, but\u00a0Chairlift turn that potential liability into a strength on two of\u00a0Something's most beautiful tracks: On \"Frigid Spring\" and \"Turning\", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling wry lyrics without getting too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of Robert Smith-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in\u00a0\"Sidewalk Safari\" or gushing with love in \"I Belong in Your Arms\", Polachek sounds totally comfortable and in control.\nThough it's obvious that Polachek is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she\u00a0actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to\u00a0Something's\u00a0success. It's notable that\u00a0their debut's best song,\u00a0\"Bruises\", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on\u00a0Something are disarmingly direct: \"If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,\" \"Does my love only count if it's proved?,\" \"My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why.\" Polachek still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on \"Amanaemonesia\", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on \"Guilty as Charged\", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.\nThe song on Something that gets me in the gut is \"I Belong in Your Arms\", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of \"I Belong in Your Arms\", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop.\n\n", "Chairlift_Does You Inspire You": "Chairlift's \"Bruises\", the most immediately catchy and memorable song on the band's debut Does You Inspire You, directly suggests its own video treatment. Imagine: an impossibly cute and dying-to-please young girl sets a camera on a tripod in her backyard and does a series of well-intentioned, but ultimately failed tumbling moves to prove her adoration of a significant other. It's almost enough to trump the fact that Apple recently licensed the song for an ad and made their own associations with it, namely a line of Nanos bleeding brightly colored paint. Not quite as cute, but if we use former Pitchfork contributor Nick Sylvester's metric for Apple's aims with ad music-- that it should sound close enough to a familiar iconic song but come at a much cheaper price-- \"Bruises\" works perfectly. At a time when most of us can still summon \"Young Folks\" and (the famously iPodded) \"1234\" from memory, and \"Bruises\"-- a whiff of soul, but a stronger aroma of feminine allure mixed with little-girl na\u00efvete-- is a more than obvious choice.\nInspire can't match the precious glee of \"Bruises\" over its uneven length, but the trio tries from different angles, toying with several other ideas. They live in Brooklyn and are touring with Yeasayer, so if you guessed \"thick, vaguely Far-Eastern new age haze\" is one of their schticks, you're not too far off. It's put to best use on album-opening \"Garbage\", which sounds like nothing else right now, musically or ideologically. Over an oddly retro-futuristic palette, something like the synth-jazz theme song to a kitschy 1970s detective drama, Caroline Polachek laments the ever-increasing mountains of post-consumer detritus (VCRs, condoms and the like) like she feverishly wrote the lyrics on the way home from WALL-E.\nDepending on your vantage, the differently alluring \"Planet Health\" could be drawn from two different worlds: The exotic sci-fi realm the title suggests, or the forgotten domain of proudly Orientalist synth-pop group Japan, on whose 1981 album Tin Drum its slap-bass, gong, and what sounds like a high-pitched koto would fit nicely. Polachek proves on \"Garbage\"-- a high-concept bit of musical eco-sympathy-- that lyrical subtlety isn't always her first priority, but the \"Planet Health\" line \"I was trained in diversity, in the garden of puberty\" drops a \"Space Olympics\"-level of awkwardness into a song that otherwise was losing me in its atmosphere. The title should give enough indication about this particular planet's topography, but to be specific, there exists a \"food pyramid\" and a \"desert of vitamins\" in this far-off world.\nOther than the Human League-suggesting \"Evident Utensil\" (that utensil, coincidentally enough for rhyming purposes, is a pencil), the rest of Inspire feels distant and thin, with minor songs buried beneath a veil of mystique. Most often, that aura switches from the final frontier, to, well, the frontier. \"Somewhere Around Here\" is ersatz Cowboy Junkies, and \"Earwig Town\" and \"Don't Give a Damn\" nod toward Southwestern twang and straight-up country, but not convincingly. And that's understandable, of course: Chairlift are young and curious, still testing sounds on the way to a unique aesthetic, which parts of Inspire shows they are capable of achieving. While \"Bruises\" proves that a well-done song that sounds like other songs can make people take brief notice, Inspire mostly proves that recycling isn't the only answer.\n", "Cobra Man_Toxic Planet": "No Review", "Cobra Man_New Driveway Soundtrack": "No Review", "Lana Del Rey_Norman Fucking Rockwell!": "In 2017, Lana Del Rey stopped performing in front of the American flag. Where the singer-songwriter born Elizabeth Grant had once stood onstage before a wavering projection of stars and stripes, charged by a brash apple-pie and blue-jeans patriotism, she now deemed the flag \u201cinappropriate,\u201d preferring a screen of static instead. For a woman whose songs are like miniature syllabi in American Studies\u2014saturated in references to jazz, girl groups, heavy metal, Springsteen; Hemingway and Fitzgerald; money, power, glory; excess and loss; Whitmanian multitudes\u2014it felt like an act of defiance.\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! is Lana at her deepest, and it arrives at a time when the history of America as we know it is being rewritten. Norman Rockwell himself illustrated idyllic images of American life and its history, spending 50 years with the Americana propagandists at the weekly Saturday Evening Post. His best-known works used a wondrous narrative style to center comfort and simplicity: A pastoral idea, painted and personified, of the American Dream. Lana neatly cuts through that outmoded fantasy with an emphatic fucking hyphen mark of irreverence, or enthusiasm, or both. As Lana revives American myths, with an empty deadpan that would make Lou Reed proud, she also exposes them. Like the Beach Boys, she\u2019s looking for America; like Elvis, she\u2019s discomfiting; like Dylan, she\u2019s a trickster, and we are all potentially fooled.\nLana is one of our most complicated stars, a constantly unresolvable puzzle\u2014someone who once called her own work \u201cmore of a psychological music endeavor\u201d than pop. But on Norman Fucking Rockwell! that ground-swelling complexity coheres to reveal an indisputable fact: She is the next best American songwriter, period. Trading much of her hardboiled trap-pop and trip-hop malaise for baroque piano ballads and dazzling folk\u2014equal parts Brill Building precision, windswept Laurel Canyon, and 2019 parlances\u2014Lana has begun a dynamic second act in profundity. \u201cI really do believe that words are one of the last forms of magic,\u201d Lana once said, and she exalts each syllable more than ever here. Where her elegant wordplay once made her the Patron Saint of Internet Feelings, she now sounds like a millennial troubadour\u2014singing tales of beloved bartenders and broken men, of fast cars and all of the senses, of freedom and transformation and the wreckage of being alive. The stakes have never been higher.\nSometimes Jack Antonoff productions seem to fly because they have been given a trampoline or a children\u2019s bouncing castle. But here, with delicacy and grace, he and Lana find new wings in minimalism, fresh air to breathe, a structural relief. From its cascade of opening piano notes\u2014\u201cGod damn, man child\u201d are felicitous first words and the national mood\u2014Norman Fucking Rockwell! achieves levity, tension, and a disarming self-awareness. The languor of Mazzy Star and downbeat skitter of Portishead meet the easy pop-rock breeze of Carole King on 1971\u2019s Tapestry, or the searching resilience of Joni Mitchell on 1972\u2019s For the Roses. It feels like a wall has come down, like Norman Fucking Rockwell! is less to do with camp, and more to do with real life; less to do with scripting the incandescent character of Lana Del Rey and more to do with human complexity; less about aesthetics than being. You can hear the room everywhere, and for all the spectral harmonies and cinematic splendor, it sounds like Lana alone, embracing classic Angeleno isolation.\nLana\u2019s pillars are intact before you even hit play: glamour, eccentricity, the absurd, wit. \u201cYour poetry\u2019s bad and you blame the news,\u201d she proclaims on the title track, with a raised eyebrow, and this forthright song grows more savage from there. On a nine-and-a-half-minute lullaby called \u201cVenice Bitch,\u201d she sings the line \u201cfresh out of fucks forever\u201d like a lilting lady of the canyon\u2014in pop tradition, Lana treats California like a conceptual promised land, and here is the smoggy sprawl, stretching into a neo-psychedelic ballad for a new age of acid festival jams. She curses like the sailors on the cover. She employs old-school lingo on the one hand (\u201cCatch ya on the flipside\u201d) and a narcotic slur on the other. And there is no other pop star who could palatably cover Sublime\u2019s \u201cDoin\u2019 Time\u201d and turn its mall-reggae into something so balmy and sweet.\nAbove all, Norman Fucking Rockwell! is the sound of a heart shattering and reforming just to shatter again\u2014of troubled people attempting to navigate the mess of love. Her ache is from empathy: for our crumbling world, for the down and out, for lovers at war with their minds. \u201cIf he\u2019s a serial killer/Then what\u2019s the worst that can happen to a girl that\u2019s already hurt?\u201d she sings like a crime novelist on \u201cHappiness Is a Butterfly,\u201d which is to say it is fleeting, setting herself up for a kind of heartbreak so torturous it should be possible to have it surgically removed. Many of these exquisitely narrated songs contain reminders that the trappings of masculinity\u2014breaches in communication, emotional stiltedness, fear of vulnerability\u2014come from the same toxic status quo as systemic patriarchy. On the wrenching \u201cCalifornia,\u201d Lana processes as much: \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to be stronger than you really are,\u201d confessing in a tumbling rush that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it but I read it in your letter/You said to a friend that you wished you were doing better.\u201d Each word is on a pedestal; the song exists to amplify them. Her faint country warble wells more with each verse, and it\u2019s devastating.\nRadiating new dimensions of sensitivity and eloquence, \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d is a towering peak on Norman Fuckng Rockwell!, a four-minute drama about fateful potential romantic energy. But its turbulent grandeur could speak to the whole Lana Del Rey story. \u201cYou took my sadness out of context\u201d and \u201cThey mistook my kindness for weakness\u201d are bold refusals to be misunderstood. Referencing Elton John with her pristine declaration \u201cI ain\u2019t no candle in the wind,\u201d a phrase originally inspired by the early deaths of Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin, is a patent embrace of life from a woman who once wrote, \u201cI wish I was dead.\u201d When she sings, \u201cI fucked up, I know that, but Jesus/Can\u2019t a girl just do the best she can?\u201d it could be a mic-dropping rebuttal to the ludicrous standards she faced from the start (and the overblown, Internet-engineered Lana outrage that now seems sexist and pathetic). The Hollywood author Eve Babitz once wrote, \u201cOnce it is established you are you and everyone else is merely perfect, ordinarily factory-like perfect\u2026 you can wreak all the havoc you want.\u201d Lana\u2019s evolution follows suit. \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d is the sort of ballad that makes teens want to bang on pianos and spill their souls.\nLana zooms out to find her zenith. A piano ballad to close down the bar at the end of the world, \u201cThe greatest\u201d collapses time, as if Lana is writing the zeitgeist on a typewriter, her lines raving up with fevered reference to rock\u2019n\u2019roll and depression and a proverbial \u201cKokomo.\u201d Turning the weight of a generation into light, her words crest like the white of a tidal wave\u2014\u201cL.A.\u2019s in flames, it\u2019s a getting hot/Kanye West is blonde and gone/\u2018Life On Mars\u2019 ain\u2019t just a song/Oh, the livestream\u2019s almost on\u201d\u2014and they feel on arrival to have existed forever. As ever, Lana regards the despondency of existence as a realist, offering a funhouse reflection of the way we live.\nCall her Doris Doomsday: \u201cThe culture is lit/And if this is it/I had a ball,\u201d she resolves with ecstasy and fire, a lightning rod of humor, sadness, and perception; flip jadedness and abiding love. Fanning the flames of a culture ablaze, Lana sings each word like a prayer, finessed with conviction and smoke, chaos and control. \u201cThe greatest\u201d is a galaxy-brain moment in the pantheon of pop, and it belongs to a generation fully aware we are at risk of being distracted into oblivion, Juuling towards early death while watching Earth burn.\nBut hope does not elude us yet. And Lana has an anthem for that, too. The title of Norman Fucking Rockwell!\u2019s grand finale is itself a doomy 16-word poem called \u201cHope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it.\u201d Whatever it was that brought Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen together half a century ago, that middle ground is in the solemn mood, hollowed space, and spiritual fortitude of this haunting song. In the muted resignation of her voice you can see her \u201ctrust no one\u201d tattoo. She rejects a world of luxury, rejects happiness and sadness both, calls herself \u201c24/7 Sylvia Plath.\u201d And in this slow, glowering procession, she points more directly to her own personal history than ever\u2014\u201cspilling my guts with the Bowery bums\u201d as a volunteer, FaceTiming her father \u201cfrom beyond the grave\u201d\u2014and soberly she sings: \u201cHope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past.\u201d In the vacant spaces between her dark phrases is the unassailable fact that people bury their pasts in order to endure them.\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! is the apotheosis of Lana Del Rey, songs of curiosity and of consequence, darkness and light, a time capsule of 2019, proof that a person cannot escape herself but she can change. Lana has said hope is dangerous because of her own experience, because in Hollywood she \u201cknows so much.\u201d Hope is dangerous because women are rarely taken seriously, from matters of authenticity to cases of assault. Hope is dangerous because the world fails women, and the bigotry to which American power is currently pitched ensures it. Lana calls herself \u201ca modern-day woman with a weak constitution,\u201d witnessing \u201ca new revolution,\u201d with \u201cmonsters still under my bed that I never could fight off.\u201d What makes this final song of survival so cutting is the palpable difficulty in her delivery. When she lands on \u201ca gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off,\u201d it sounds like an oblique image of corrupted power, as upsetting as it ought to be, one to finally drain her of hope. But she still has it. In a piercing falsetto we rarely if ever hear from Lana, perhaps saved for her most pressing truth, she touches the sky: \u201cI have it, I have it, I have it.\u201d And when she does, you believe her.\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Lana Del Rey_Lust For Life": "We were instantly entranced when Lana Del Rey\u2019s \u201cVideo Games\u201d surfaced six summers ago\u2014candid but aloof, artfully homemade, haunted in tone with a video that felt like a message in a bottle washed ashore for reasons yet unknown. Del Rey didn\u2019t give easy answers, but we still asked all the wrong questions in return, demanding clearer demarcation between the woman born Elizabeth Grant, the character known as Del Rey, and the millennial-outreach focus groups we presumed to have masterminded the whole thing. It\u2019s a drag to rehash the Born to Die discourse now\u2014a conversation so tediously narrow over a body of work that would prove, over the next five years, to be thrillingly rich.\nSince the drastically superior Paradise Edition reissue of Born to Die, Del Rey has neither swayed nor settled. Instead, doubling down on her palette of inky blues and blacks, the singer-songwriter has delivered a trio of dark, dense, radio-agnostic albums that stand wholly apart from any of her pop music peers. If there\u2019s anything about Del Rey that\u2019s obvious by now, it\u2019s that she means it\u2014all of it. Every word, every sigh, every violin swell, the Whitman quotes and JFK fantasies and soft ice cream.\nStill, even for the converted, it\u2019s almost too easy to trip into the endless black holes of Del Rey\u2019s universe, where Hollywood sits at the very center in glamorous ruin. Her songs overflow with the iconography of America at its most mythic: purple mountains\u2019 majesty, rockets\u2019 red gleaming, Monroe, Manson. Her layers on layers of symbolism can be disorienting, as I imagine Del Rey intends them to be, encouraging endless cross-references and deep-dive readings of her work that seek to apply some grand cinematic theory to it all\u2014and perhaps there is. But her fourth full-length, Lust for Life, suggests that at its best and truest, Del Rey\u2019s music is sublimely simple: one voice, one story, one meaning. For years, it seemed Del Rey\u2019s artistry lay in her ability to offer herself as a concept pursued to its logical end. Lust for Life presents her as something more interesting: a great American storyteller.\nTwo things immediately set Lust for Life apart from the rest of Del Rey\u2019s catalog. First, that smile, beaming from the belladonna of sadness, posed in front of the same truck from the Born to Die artwork. Even stranger: the tracklist is packed with features for the first time since we\u2019ve known her. This would be Del Rey\u2019s \u201chappy album,\u201d fans predicted\u2014or worse, an obligatory pivot into wokeness. As it turns out, Lust for Life isn\u2019t outright happy or overtly political (and thank god for that), though Del Rey is re-examining her relationship with Americana. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have the American flag waving while I\u2019m singing \u2019Born to Die,\u2019\u201d she said recently, of her current tour visuals. \u201cI\u2019d rather have static.\u201d Beyond a symbolic \u201cPardon Our Dust\u201d sign for a nation in turmoil, it\u2019s an apt representation of the moment Lust for Life captures\u2014a record of transition, documenting not so much the result of a profound change in worldview as the process of change itself.\nPerhaps the most significant departure here is evident from Lust for Life\u2019s first song, \u201cLove\u201d\u2014a warm, grainy, \u201950s-rock anthem (and by far the album\u2019s best single) in which Del Rey shifts focus from her own internal struggle to address her audience directly. \u201cLook at you kids, you know you\u2019re the coolest,\u201d she sings reassuringly, relinquishing her role as the protagonist. The effect is that of a slow pan, the frame creeping outward from Del Rey and stretching gently towards the horizon. That impulse towards a communal understanding of her universe appears most obviously in songs like \u201cGod Bless America - And All the Beautiful Women in It\u201d and \u201cWhen the World Was At War We Kept Dancing,\u201d two pared-down folk ballads with souped-up low ends (the former includes instrumentation by Metro Boomin, with errant gunfire punctuating the chorus).\nThese are titles that may have once implied a campy wink but now appear entirely sincere\u2014songs for figuring out exactly where the fuck we are now. And more than any specific predecessor within the folk canon, they remind me\u2014as does much of Lust for Life\u2014of the paintings of Edward Hopper, a realist who captured a new American landscape, as figurative as it was physical. Hopper painted isolated, voyeuristic scenes of the anxiety and ennui of an increasingly urbanized nation set against the totems of Americana (diners, motels, highway gas stations). His work buzzed with the tension between tradition and progress, the cold power of the new against the sublimity of the natural world. Like Hopper, Del Rey\u2019s realism functions doubly as impressionism\u2014literal representation as a means to capture the feeling of life in America.\nThere are moments on Lust for Life that, while less successful on a pure songwriting level than some of Del Rey\u2019s more focused work, are fascinating distillations of what a Lana Del Rey song means. On \u201cCoachella - Woodstock In My Mind,\u201d a song built to withstand the expected eye-rolls, Del Rey soaks in a Father John Misty festival performance, taking stock of the sea of flower crowns in the crowd as she draws lines from the moment out towards the past and future. It\u2019s the most meta song in her catalog\u2014a sweet and self-aware acknowledgment of the entire Lana Del Rey thing\u2014and that\u2019s before the chorus breaks into an impossibly graceful nod to \u201cStairway to Heaven.\u201d And if the first verse of Sean Lennon duet \u201cTomorrow Never Came\u201d\u2014with its references to Bob Dylan, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Elton John\u2014felt like an oversaturation of her symbol-heavy lexicon, Del Rey reinvents \u201cdoing the most\u201d anew on the bridge: \u201cIsn\u2019t life crazy, I said, now that I\u2019m singing with Sean?\u201d It is at once hilarious and flooring, and I can picture no other artist but Del Rey being able to pull it off.\nBut the best parts of Lust for Life are simpler\u2014songs that succeed not to the extent to which they concentrate the Lana Del Rey mythos, that present her songwriting as poetry that can stand on its own. There is \u201cCherry,\u201d a cavernous torch song that reminds you Del Rey\u2019s always been more Cat Power than pop star, rumbling with paranoid sub bass and waterlogged echoes of trap drums\u2014the least obvious and most effective allusion to Del Rey\u2019s connection with the way rap production sounds now (though Playboi Carti serving as the long-lost Shangri-La back-up ad-libber on \u201cSummer Bummer\u201d is an inspired touch). Her lyricism has reached a new level of sophistication, switching from devastatingly plainspoken (\u201dReal love is like feeling no fear/When you\u2019re standing in the face of danger/\u2019Cause you just want it so much\u201d) to the more abstract and sensual. There are visions of black beaches, burning roses, summer wine, and peaches, inexplicably ruined; it all feels like a Vanitas for contemporary America\u2014a still life of soft decay. And on \u201c13 Beaches,\u201d a Hollywood film score that stutters and thuds into narcotic rap drums and \u201990s alternative angst, Del Rey merges her symbolism and literalism into something like zen poetry: \u201cIt took 13 beaches/To find one empty/But finally it\u2019s mine.\u201d It\u2019s at once a document of lived experience (escaping the paparazzi across a string of beaches last summer) and a meditation on the sublime\u2014the symbol of the thing embedded in the thing itself.\nAnd though Lust for Life\u2019s lengthy midsection could benefit from further editing, Del Rey saves the album\u2019s two most stunning and thematically essential songs for last. \u201cChange,\u201d recorded the night before the album was due, consists of nothing more than Del Rey and a piano, contrary to her penchant for wall-of-sound epics. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in,\u201d she sings in a pointedly small voice, leaving rhyme schemes behind. \u201cIt\u2019s coming in softly, on the wings of a bomb.\u201d It\u2019s a record sung from inside the curl of a cresting wave\u2014the feeling of something happening, around you and inside you before you\u2019ve figured out exactly what it means. And on \u201cGet Free,\u201d Del Rey delivers, at last, the album\u2019s mission statement: \u201cFinally, I\u2019m crossing the threshold/From the ordinary world/To the reveal of my heart.\u201d It is not so much a revelation as a promise that one is coming, and when she sings plainly, \u201cThis is my commitment,\u201d the album cover\u2019s uncharacteristic smile reveals itself not as a declaration of happiness, but a reminder that it\u2019s still worth believing in.\n", "Lana Del Rey_Honeymoon": "On the cover of Honeymoon, we see our star, Lana Del Rey, the idle passenger of a parked convertible Hollywood tourmobile, gazing behind her through face-obscuring shades. As an artist, she's\u00a0never shied away from the obvious, but the image feels almost too on-the-nose, too apt\u2014Lana doing The Full Lana. And yet, that's exactly what\u00a0Honeymoon gives us\u2014it\u00a0is Lana Del Rey's purest album-length expression, and her most artistic one.\nAccordingly, Honeymoon is a dark work, darker even than Ultraviolence, and the pall does not lift for its 60-plus minutes. It's an album about love, but \"love\", as Del Rey sings it, sounds like mourning. The romance here is closer to addiction\u2014something that's sought for its ability to blot out the rest of life's miseries. On the title track, when she croons \"Our honeymoon/ Say you want me too\", she's dopily hopeful as Brian Wilson singing \"We could be married/ And then we'll be happy.\" The album luxuriates in this bleak space between dream and reality, which stretches endlessly from one melancholy track to the next. It's not until \"The Blackest Day\", eleven songs in, that Honeymoon's static depression gives way to apocalyptic ecstasy, as she gasps \"In all the wrong places/ Oh my God\" in multi-tracked harmonies on the chorus. The moment is Honeymoon's emotional apex, but it still moves at the pace of a funeral march, and the release it depicts is that of embracing rock bottom.\nThe morose orchestral grandeur of the album feels like an arrival point, and also possibly a dead-end: the sentimentality and drama\u00a0throws back to old Hollywood\u00a0film scores. The setting is pitch-perfect and a million mothballed years away from the current pop landscape; it's strange, a barometer of youth culture trading in such old music. As a singer, Del Rey sounds more like the singer of her pre-Lana Lizzy Grant days here, when she was was performing torch songs in secretarial skirts at A&R showcases, looking too young to seem so haunted. Her previous two records felt like earnest stabs at finding a pop context for that voice, but they were both overwrought, and Honeymoon's arrangements feel built to rectify that.\nHoneymoon acknowledges what, or rather\u00a0who, we are here for. It knows that we want big, sad, fucked-up epics. It's rare to get to a chorus within the first minute, and until that point it's usually just Lana, maybe a little guitar or some cinematic strings. The programmed drums of \"High by the Beach\" and \"Religion\" wait nearly a minute to enter, and \"Terrence Loves \u00a0You\" is even sparser. Many tracks expand sleepily past the five- or six-minute mark, which is to say that Honeymoon's languor takes our attention for granted. Which is certainly not a mistake.\nWhile she's obviously a pop artist, Honeymoon feels as though it belongs to a larger canon of Southern California Gothic albums\u2014Celebrity Skin, Hotel California, The Hissing of Summer Lawns. She sings about it all\u2014the sprawl, toxicity, the culture of transactional relationships, the particulars of the light (\"God Knows I Tried\")\u2014with an East Coast blue-blood accent (\"scared\" becomes \"skaaaahd\"). All the gee-whiz irony of previous albums is gone, often she sounds like ABBA's Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog roused from a nap, sweet but disconnected.\nLike Joan Didion's ur-California girl transplant, Maria Wyeth, Del Rey sings like a woman who \"knows what 'nothing' means\"\u2014on \"High by the Beach\", \"Freak\", and \"Art Deco\" she sounds beyond longing, like it's been a long time since she felt anything at all. She is cruelly incisive on \"Art Deco\" (\"you're just born to be seen\"), a highlight that curdles when the careless phrase \"You're so ghetto\" comes out in the chorus. It's one of the few tonal misfires on an album that otherwise feels like Del Rey moving into the temple she's built.\nShe has been transfixed by, and riffing on, America since the beginning, but Honeymoon pushes past easy Kennedy kitsch and undulating flags to mine something more specific. In the opening track, she sings \"We could cruise/ To the blues/ Wilshire Boulevard,\" and the name check is shrewd. One of L.A.'s earliest thoroughfares, a locus of establishing the city's car culture, Wilshire runs sixteen miles, and as architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne writes, \"can take you from a world-famous piece of architecture to a weed-choked lot, from a realized ambition to an abandoned one, in the space of a few blocks.\"\nIn the following verse, she replaces blues with \"news\" and substitutes \"Pico Blvd.\", which is working class for its duration, bi-secting Koreatown and running through Ecuadorian, Salvadoran, Russian, and Mexican communities.\u00a0The juxtaposition is startling and canny. In the space of one lyric, she posits the invisible, real city running parallel to the gleaming, manufactured one, sketching an arterial map of a city coursing with ambition. It reminds us of\u00a0something that was the very issue with Del Rey that irritated some early on\u2014she knows exactly what she is doing. Honeymoon just synthesizes ideas she's been vamping on from the beginning into a unified work. She\u00a0figured where she was going long before she got there; with\u00a0Honeymoon\u00a0she has finally arrived.\n", "Lana Del Rey_Ultraviolence (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Lana Del Rey_Ultraviolence": "Lana Del Rey, the creation of singer and songwriter Lizzy Grant, is all alone. She\u2019s an utterly distinctive figure in popular music\u2014not part of a scene, with no serious imitators\u2014and befitting someone completely off on her own, she\u2019s lonely. Where her last full-length, the frequently terrible Born to Die, tried on different moods and looked at her character from a few angles, Ultraviolence finds one feeling\u2014a seedy, desperate, hyper-romanticized sense of isolation and loss\u2014and blows it up to drive-in screen proportions, saturating the color riding the blue crest of sadness for the better part of an hour. Whether or not you want to take this particular ride will largely depend on how much stock you put in \u201cauthenticity,\u201d your tolerance for Del Rey\u2019s vocal tics, and your reflexive response to her lyrics.\nCreating a semi-fictional delivery system for your creative ideas is nothing new, but few have had Del Rey\u2019s commitment to the idea\u2014imagine Madonna sticking with Breathless Mahoney for multiple album cycles. This far in, after so many interviews and so much media attention, we don\u2019t know all that much about Lana Del Rey, and we\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re told is real. She\u2019s become a screen onto which we project our desire and/or our loathing. With Ultraviolence, Del Rey has found new synergy between the character she presents to the world and the content of the songs.\nGone are annoying trifles like Born to Die\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d and \u201cDiet Mountain Dew\u201d; in their place are slow, atmospheric songs filled with theatrical melancholy and a parade of women in trouble who mourn for men who treat them badly yet somehow remain irresistible. The lyrics are studded with her trademark iconography: \u201che hit me and it felt like a kiss\u201d; \u201cthe sun also rises\u201d; \u201ctalking about my generation\u201d; a reference to \u201cSunset and Vine\u201d and another to \u201cstrange weather.\u201d But here she\u2019s found the perfect musical vehicle for her vision. Ultraviolence sounds tragic and beautiful\u2014darkly-shaded ballads are what she was created to make, and this album is nothing but, a Concept Album from a Concept Human.\nThe first section of the album is so gorgeous and rich, Ultraviolence at first seems better than it is. The Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach, who produced much of the record, turns out to be Del Rey's ideal creative partner, crafting lush walls of sound that evoke her favorite cultural era, a time when the prim and surface-level 1960s were just starting their slide into drug-fueled decadence. \u201cCruel World\u201d is a six-minute dirge that 30 years ago might have been sung by Bonnie Tyler, its twangy guitars and thudding drums exploding at just the right moments. The title track\u2019s gorgeous chorus dresses up a song where love and physical abuse are intertwined. Del Rey\u2019s angelic interval leap on the chorus of \u201cShades of Cool\u201d is a new addition to her small array of vocal effects, bringing to mind the faux-Asian sweep of Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cYou Only Live Twice\u201d mixed with the song that lured the prince in Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty. They\u2019re songs that would make no sense if anyone else sang them. In this way, and a few others, she draws inspiration from rap music, broadcasting her obsessions and forcing you to engage with the persona first and the content of the songs second.\nIt\u2019s an impressive opening shot, and there are a few moments in this sequence that make you want to sit back and say, \u201cHold on, is this for real?\u201d But then comes \u201cBrooklyn Baby\u201d, a song that references Lou Reed, a rare jazz collection, feathers in hair, the \u201cfreedom land of the \u201970s,\u201d and \u201cchurning out novels like beat poetry on amphetamines.\u201d Is Del Rey taking the piss, making fun of lifestyle accessories as a source of identity? Or is she celebrating these icons, the way she has so many others, reveling in the colorful tapestry that is American popular culture?\nTurns out these are the wrong questions. When lines like these pop up on the record, I find myself chuckling, sometimes laughing out loud, which might seem odd on an album about sadness. But that says something about how strange Del Rey's music can be, and the internal coherence of the worlds she creates. These songs don\u2019t ask you to respond in any particular way; they evoke heartbreak one moment and they\u2019re ridiculous the next, and those qualities don\u2019t cancel each other out. It\u2019s entertainment, camp, and the ambiguity of it all, nurtured by the cool distance of Lana Del Rey\u2019s image, is a huge part of the music\u2019s appeal. Those who really hate what she\u2019s about\u2014and there are a lot of these people\u2014look for something in music that she has no interest in providing. To enjoy what she does, you have to give yourself over to her media-saturated fantasy and put the everyday on hold, and you also have to lay aside pop radio\u2019s typically sunny affirmations.\nBut this thing Lana Del Rey is going for isn\u2019t easy to sustain, and it starts to go south during the back half of Ultraviolence. The album grows tiresome somewhere during the stretch where \u201cPretty When You Cry\u201d leads to \u201cMoney Power Glory\u201d and then on to \u201cFucked My Way Up to the Top\u201d. The melodies are a little less interesting and, instead of melodramatic fables, she settles for button-pushing. It\u2019s also wearying to spend this much time in the presence of this particular character. The masochism, the self-hatred, the drugs, the emotional world filtered through the tragic figures American teenagers are drawn to gets old. You can feel Lana Del Rey inching into territory where she\u2019s daring you not to like her, and by the time you get to the Ultraviolence bonus track \u201cFlorida Kilos\u201d, a Harmony Korine co-write that might as well be called\u00a0Spring Breakers: The Audiobook, you begin to remember why many people find the whole project repellant. Still, it\u2019d be wrong to overlook the many things Ultraviolence does well, and how sui generis Lana Del Rey is. She\u2019s a pop music original full-stop, and there are not nearly enough of those around.\n", "Lana Del Rey_Ultraviolence - Audio Commentary": "No Review", "Lana Del Rey_Born To Die - The Paradise Edition": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Work From Home With Minimalism": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Tales from the Loop (Original Soundtrack)": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: King Lear": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Musical Offering": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Glass: Violin Concerto No. 2 \"The American Four Seasons\" & Violin Sonata": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Venezuelan Elegy": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Glass: Glassworlds": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Vol. 6": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: The Fall of the House of Usher": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Annunciation": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Metamorphosis I-V": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Symphony No.5 \"Requiem": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Bardo": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Nirmanakaya\"": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Mishima": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass Soundtracks Vol. II": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Samurai Marathon": "No Review", "Philip Glass_A Descent into the Maelstr\u00f6m": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: The Not-Doings of an Insomniac": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Perpetulum: Philip Glass": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Gavin Bryars": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Third Coast Percussion": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: The Hours / Distant Figure": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Philip Glass: Symphony No.11": "No Review", "Philip Glass_Glass: 3 Pieces in the Shape of a Square": "No Review", "ElVy_Wildboy": "No Review", "ElVy_Calboy the Wild Boy": "No Review", "ElVy_Anxiety": "No Review", "Dua Lipa_Future Nostalgia": "No 2017 pop release had legs like Dua Lipa\u2019s self-titled debut. \u201cNew Rules,\u201d the know-your-worth anthem that became her breakout, was actually the sixth single from an album delayed eight months past its original release date.

The Athens, Ala. band were part of a \"Memphis Soul\" revue celebrating that city\u2019s groundbreaking '60s sounds, which famously featured black and white musicians working together to make lasting hits like \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" in the thick of the civil rights era. The visual symbolism of the event was powerful, a historically rich triumph of the unity that soul music has often portended: As the nation\u2019s first black president looked on, multiracial Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard led her band of white instrumentalists\u2014along with Memphis greats Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper\u2014on the classic 1967 blues track \"Born Under a Bad Sign\". Barack and Michelle nodded their heads in respectful rhythm. Malia seemed mildly amused. Sasha, meanwhile, was bored. Like, remarkably bored. Her flat stare was the type usually reserved for dentist waiting rooms or Target customer service lineups. Her obligatory golf clap at the end of the song was wan to the point of noiselessness.\nHoward, for her part, could probably see where the youngest Obama was coming from. During the performance, the singer paced impatiently, seemingly humbled by the pageantry and also perhaps feeling a little constricted by the antiquity of it all. It wasn\u2019t that Howard and her band didn\u2019t know their blues; the working-class quartet came from a small town in the mythic South and cut their teeth on hours-long sets of covers. And when the frontwoman belted, \"Hard luck and trouble been my only friend/ I been on my own ever since I was 10,\" the lines held pointed meaning for Howard since she lost her older sister\u2014and only sibling\u2014to cancer when she was around that age. But for all their preternatural grit, sweat, and passion (along with every other age-old signifier of rock'n'roll authenticity known to man), Alabama Shakes were never quite comfortable with the retro-soul box many placed them into upon their arrival in 2012. To be fair, their debut, Boys & Girls, certainly deserved the tag, its vintage moves elevated mostly by Howard\u2019s gale-force delivery, an instrument that could have blown Otis Redding back. The band\u2019s effortless charm, instant familiarity, and Great Recession recovery anthem \"Hold On\" made them easy to root for, and the album went onto sell more than 700,000 copies. It felt as if they could be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at any moment.\nAnd yet, the idea taking on the mantle of '60s soul was never part of the plan for Alabama Shakes. In interviews, they casually distanced themselves from the pure revivalists of Daptone Records while repping for theatrical sensationalists like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and My Chemical Romance; their origin story had Howard noticing bassist Zac Cockrell because he was wearing an At the Drive-In shirt; when the band hit \"Saturday Night Live\" recently, Howard wore earrings emblazoned with Prince\u2019s face. \"We just don\u2019t wanna own the classic R&B title and let people down,\" guitarist Heath Fogg diplomatically stated around the release of Boys & Girls, \"because when we go electronic on the next record it might break some hearts.\"\nSound & Color is not an electronic record. But it is strange and mystical and unexpected\u2014more Houses of the Holy than \"Holy Cow\". It\u2019s got past lives and future people, traces of Curtis Mayfield, Erykah Badu, MC5, the Strokes. There\u2019s a song called \"Shoegaze\" that could find a second home on the Rolling Stones\u2019 Tattoo You. Bon Iver collaborator Rob Moose provides eerie string arrangements that slowly encroach on songs like ivy climbing up a fence while the band and co-producer Blake Mills tweak tones and rhythms to make guitars and drums and bass and keyboards sound genuinely exciting\u2014fresh, even\u2014in 2015. This is stadium soul with one eye peeking toward another galaxy while hands and feet and throats desperately try to suss out life here on Earth.\nOf course, Howard is at the center of it all. Over the course of the last three years, she\u2019s managed to take complete control over her unbridled voice without losing a smidge of spontaneity. She\u2019s no longer just building toward an ecstatic climax (though there are several of those here), but rather exploring the upper reaches of her register, cajoling instead of hollering, taking on operatic cadences. The singer, who took part in both raucous Baptist services as well as a cappella hymns in the Church of Christ growing up, layers her vocals on almost every track, offering harmonies and ghosts that can\u2019t help but follow her around; on one bipolar love song, what sounds like ghoulish laughter echoes behind Howard as she pours her being into the words \"gimme all your love!\" Is she reveling in her desires? Sending up her larger-than-life voice? Smiling into the void of unrequited love? Yes, yes, and yes.\nAs a lyricist, Howard excels at spinning down-home profundity that make her sound her age, 26, and years beyond. Along with her tales of haunted love, cautious optimism, and impassioned pacifism come more impressionistic songs that mean to find connections between epochs and space. She and her band travel through the blues back to a bad sign\u2014or is it a good one?\u2014on \"Gemini\", a six-and-a-half-minute excursion into zero-gravity funk. Whereas Alabama Shakes once seemed destined to relive the history of others, they invent their own genesis here, as weeds grow near the Tennessee River and eyes reveal dreams that eventually must wake up. And just as the song comes to a close, it keeps going for a little while longer.\n", "Alabama Shakes_Sound & Color (Bonus Track Version)": "No Review", "Alabama Shakes_Boys & Girls": "Alabama Shakes' lead singer, guitarist and primary songwriter Brittany Howard began cobbling her band together in high school mostly just for the sake of having a band. It certainly wasn't with the notion of breaking into her hometown's music scene-- in Athens, Ala., there's not much of one to break into. So she and her friends Steve Johnson, Zac Cockrell, and Heath Fogg made do playing cover-band gigs in dive bars, occasionally slipping their raggedy garage-soul originals in among the Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, and eventually making enough to warrant some studio time up in Nashville early last year. Those sessions produced the 11 tracks of Alabama Shakes' debut LP, Boys & Girls, which they shopped around for a while and finally released on ATO (Rough Trade in the UK) this week.\nThings are now moving fast: The band has hit the late-night TV circuit, they followed Fiona Apple's headlining slot at NPR's big SXSW showcase last month, their upcoming shows are almost entirely sold-out, and they've been booked as openers for Jack White's spring solo tour.\nOf course, because Alabama Shakes boast these fairly aw-shucks origins, lyrics that seem deeply felt, multiple sonic reference points predating 1975, an affinity for analog, and more than one guitar,\u00a0by default\u00a0they've been thrown like chum into the shark tank that is \"real music,\" where fans and critics with false memories of rock's pure and noble past-- and others with aversions to earnest craft both feigned and actual-- gnash out their differences.\nBut engaging with these paranoid extremes bypasses the whole middle swath of the matter-- the weird, beautiful part, where all the blood and guts are. Here's what seems real enough to me: Boys & Girls is a solid debut, really good but not earth-shifting, a record clearly (blessedly) recorded before anyone much cared who they were or weren't, possibly even before they were entirely sure themselves.\nThe album is largely confessional-- not in the singer/songwritery sense, but in that it's riddled with admissions that probably wouldn't have been made by any other means, words that feel lighter sung than spoken. Album opener and lead single \"Hold On\", its central guitar riff ribboning and pooling like slow-poured honey, is the first of many tracks where it's not entirely clear if Howard is singing to, about, or as herself, God, or some boy as she rips through the chorus: \"Yeah, you got to wait/ But I don't want to wait!\" \"I feel so homesick/ Where is my home?\" Howard wonders on \"Rise to the Sun\" before the song dips into a coda of timorous guitar and crashing drums. On the shadowy, fingersnapped \"Goin' to the Party\" she sings about running around town, getting wasted, and taking care of some drunk boy; when she woozily coos, \"gotta take me back now, I'm still somebody's daughter,\" she sounds half-annoyed and half-comforted in that very particular way that comes from being young and restless and knowing there's someone waiting up for you, but at least there's someone waiting up for you.\nHoward's pain feels raw, but like it won't always be-- as if once these first scrapes heal, her skin will be good and tough, but right now they smart like hell. \"Heartbreaker\" is staggering, gut-punched, a shiny organ weeping and straining away as she laments, \"Oh, I wanted to grow old with you/ You told me so, but then you go/ How was I supposed to know?\" But later on the slow-boiling \"Be Mine\" she's regained her footing-- she's direct, nearly petulant: \"If they wanna fight/ They done started fucking with the wrong heart.\" Three minutes in the song shifts focus to a single demand, Howard crowing and screaming, \"Be my baby, be my baby!\" over and over as the band spins out, crashing and bumping, then circles back home as she loosens into a string of cries and hoots.\nLive, Howard often plants her feet flat onstage before bellowing out a line, as if bracing herself against the force of what's to come, and it's easy to imagine her doing that in the studio, too. Most of the time there's a payoff, but sometimes the build-up dwarfs the delivery, her voice coming out thinner and tighter than you'd expect; maybe she needs a vocal coach, or just a little more time to work out exactly how those pipes of hers like best to blow. For now, though, flashes of more contemporary analogs (Macy Gray, Amy Winehouse) swirled in among the more obvious classic-soul vocal touchstones keep her Janis Joplin tendencies from curdling into \"Jackie Jormp-Jomp\".\nBoys & Girls was recorded live in the studio, but the power of the band's stage show hasn't fully carried over-- at times their delivery also seems thin and tight. Perhaps it's a matter of timing, the number and profile and intensity of the gigs the band has played in recent months solidifying their groove to a degree that outstrips what they were capable of throwing down on tape this time last year. Or maybe it's the production-- a little muddled, and not always in the cozy, old-school way they may have been going for. So many bands get churned out of the hype machine seeming either too fully formed or too ephemeral to get attached to, but Alabama Shakes have sparked, in me at least, a degree of ownership, and one that urges, \"work with Jack White.\" Maybe sometime this summer, after the tour, he could work his analog-only magic and coax some big, crunching, whalloping mess out of them--something to ensure they get to stick around for a while, and on their own terms: weird, sweaty, desirous.\n", "Woodkid_Desierto (Original Motion Picture Score)": "No Review", "Woodkid_The Golden Age": "No Review", "The Shoes_Still Killin' Time": "No Review", "The Shoes_The Clint Black Christmas Collection": "No Review", "The Shoes_On Purpose": "No Review", "The Shoes_The Love Songs": "No Review", "The Shoes_Drinkin' Songs & Other Logic": "No Review", "The Shoes_Christmas With You": "No Review", "The Shoes_Spend My Time": "No Review", "The Shoes_Ultimate Clint Black": "No Review", "The Shoes_Super Hits": "No Review", "The Shoes_D'Lectrified": "No Review", "The Shoes_D' Lectrified": "No Review", "The Shoes_Nothin' But The Taillights": "No Review", "The Shoes_One Emotion": "No Review", "The Shoes_No Time To Kill": "No Review", "The Shoes_The Hard Way": "No Review", "The Shoes_Put Yourself In My Shoes": "No Review", "The Shoes_Killin' Time": "No Review", "Maroon 5_Red Pill Blues + (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Maroon 5_Red Pill Blues (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Maroon 5_V (Extended Edition)": "No Review", "Maroon 5_V (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Maroon 5_V Japan Special Edition": "No Review", "Maroon 5_V (Asia Tour Edition)": "No Review", "Maroon 5_V": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_The Black Parade / Living with Ghosts (The 10th Anniversary Edition)": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_May Death Never Stop You": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_The Black Parade Is Dead!": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_The Black Parade": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_Life on the Murder Scene": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge": "Donna and Donald Way lived in a particularly bleak apartment in the gloomy little township of Belleville, a New Jersey suburb often mentioned in news stories about crime rings and mob trials. Donna, a hairdresser, had a penchant for horror films and eerie decor\u2014at one point she filled an entire room with Victorian dolls. It was here, in a wood-paneled basement unit filled with gothic kitsch like petrified bats and lifelike human skulls, that their son Gerard spent most of his childhood. He posted up in a bedroom with only one window the size of a cinder block, fomenting the outcast mentality that would later manifest in My Chemical Romance.\nNorthern New Jersey would soon become home to a thriving hardcore and emo scene in the early 2000s, one that would eventually propel Gerard\u2019s band to global recognition. But as children, the suburbs could be restrictive: \u201cOur parents were kind of scared to let us out of the house,\u201d Gerard\u2019s younger brother, Mikey, said later. \u201cIt was mostly me and Gerard.\u201d The Way brothers chose to make the best of their cramped environs. They were into horror movies and comic books, and made up characters and stories together to compensate for the loneliness. For Gerard, comics became more than a hobby; after becoming an amateur artist in his own right, selling his first comic book at age 15, he enrolled in the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\nAfter graduating, Gerard nearly landed a TV pilot on Cartoon Network for a show about a Scandanavian monkey that could magically make breakfast out of thin air. But in 2001, when he saw the Twin Towers collapse during his morning commute, he found himself pulled away from his previous passion. Disillusioned and traumatized, he gave up his career, finding the world of TV executives insufficiently radical, too profit-driven and slow for the intensity of the post-9/11 era. Seeing local hardcore heroes Thursday perform at a small club flipped a switch: \u201cI wanted to make a bigger impact,\u201d he said later. After roping in his brother and local music nerd Ray Toro, who had the frazzled look and finger-picking acumen of a snobbish Guitar Center tech, My Chemical Romance was born a week later.\nToday, My Chemical Romance are ubiquitous\u2014a meme, a cult, an aesthetic. Though the term \u201cemo\u201d has long stuck to the band, their mix of vaudevillian pomp and four-on-the-floor punk progressions was more indicative of a new direction for the sub-genre. But they remained relevant long after the sound they championed died out commercially in the late 2000s. Rather than the pinch of nostalgia or embarrassment that often accompanies revisiting the histrionic lyrics of that era, My Chemical Romance subverted shame by embracing their gothic attire, wearing it like a base layer from which they could build unexpectedly melodic pop. When they announced their reunion earlier this year, fans embraced them not like a ratty relic of childhood, but like a long-lost heirloom that had finally been returned.\nPerhaps their lasting appeal is because the band never wanted to strictly write about passing teenage anxieties. Their early songs were a direct response to the attacks of September 11. \u201cSkylines and Turnstiles,\u201d the first song Gerard wrote, teemed with heightened existential dread: \u201cAfter seeing what we saw/Can we still reclaim our innocence?\u201d The \u201cAttic Demos,\u201d recorded in 2001 in the attic of their then-drummer, barely made it past the North New Jersey punk scene\u2014the production was tinny and compressed, Gerard\u2019s voice was strained and out of tune. But the demo conveyed an earnest commitment to storytelling and a glimmer of ambition, enough to convince local punk stalwart Frank Iero to join as a rhythm guitarist: \u201cThere was just something about it where you could already imagine what it would sound like,\u201d he said.\nMy Chemical Romance released their official debut, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in July 2002. The record, produced by Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly and released on local punk mainstay Eyeball Records, had the hallmarks of the hardcore scene that surrounded them: guitars ripped through verses; clean vocals slipped into shredded screams. But My Chemical Romance stood out for its dedication to fantasy, writing the album loosely told from the perspective of a vampiric protagonist who must avenge his lover\u2019s death. Their bombastic live shows, so violent and destructive they often led to broken glass, landed them a manager and, before long, a record deal with the Warner Bros. offshoot Reprise. Before the end of 2003, they\u2019d outgrow the small Passaic clubs they used to frequent. By 2004, thanks to an optimistic album review in The Guardian, they\u2019d be playing headlining shows across the UK, scoring a series of glowing write-ups in Kerrang! and NME before they even began recording their major-label debut.\nThe deal with Reprise gave the band access to their pick of producers. Their first choice, rock oracle Butch Vig, was busy, so they landed on Howard Benson, who had once worked with Mot\u00f6rhead but, more recently, had taken on the dregs of nu-metal with groups like Crazy Town and Hoobastank. Benson and My Chemical Romance were a strange pair. When he first arrived at the studio, wearing his usual uniform of sweatpants and a hockey jersey, the band allegedly mistook him for a pizza delivery guy. Everyone referred to him as \u201ca sports coach\u201d who would largely communicate in basketball metaphors. But Benson challenged the band to work on song structure and melody, pushing back against extra guitar solos and abrupt endings\u2014saying things like, \u201c\u2018What does this have to do with the rest of the song? You\u2019re confusing the shit out of me,\u2019\u201d as Gerard later recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d the band would yell in return.\nBut Benson\u2019s coaching pushed the album, what we now know as Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, to its emotive peaks. While recording \u201cThe Ghost of You,\u201d a seething song about loss, Benson convinced the band to include a final chorus to end the song. (\u201cWe all hated having that chorus in that song,\u201d Toro later said.) My Chemical Romance came from a world in which nothing trumped the brute force of a scream like Rickly\u2019s or an overdriven guitar-heavy outro; the original ending had both. But Benson\u2019s formulaic approach helped anchor the pensive ballad: With that final chorus\u2014a defiant, unabashedly self-serious crescendo\u2014 the band displayed a glimmer of the massive arena rock they\u2019d go on to write for 2006\u2019s The Black Parade. \u201cThe Ghost of You\u201d shot to top the UK Rock and Metal Singles chart.\nOn its face, Three Cheers was a lofty concept record about star-crossed lovers who die in a gunfight, who must then \u201cbring the devil the souls of 1,000 evil men\u201d in order to be reunited in the afterlife. But it\u2019s a conceit loosely held. Instead of a vigilante shootout, Three Cheers ripples to life with \u201cHelena,\u201d a guilt-laden tribute to the Ways\u2019 grandmother, Elena, who died while the band was away on tour. The track begins with a restrained, reverberating guitar and Gerard\u2019s voice at nearly a whisper. Then, almost like a jump scare at a haunted house, the band comes in at full volume: a legion of distortion, led by a full-throated yelp from Gerard.\nWhile the songs on Three Cheers are certainly allegories for ennui and narcissism, they are often equally escapist explorations into storytelling and world-building. We meet our protagonist outright in \u201cGive \u2019Em Hell, Kid,\u201d as he journeys up from New Orleans pumped full of stimulants and ready to exact his revenge. By the third track, \u201cTo The End,\u201d he\u2019s inside a mansion to murder a wedding party, dropping small details\u2014homosexual undertones, allusions to William Faulkner\u2014like little breadcrumbs. The narrative also helps to unite an otherwise disparate record; by the time the Morricone whistles kick in on \u201cHang \u2019Em High,\u201d they seem fitting in service of the story. The band, and Benson, carefully balanced these large gestures to literary tropes with hooks and choruses that are more in line with a typical rock song. Still, like the band members cooped up in Jersey basements a decade prior, the fans who needed it found an escape, a record that didn\u2019t just lament a sleepy one-horse town, but transported them out of it entirely.\nOn the most successful manifestation of the album\u2019s concept, the jaunty \u201cYou Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison,\u201d the band strikes a memorable balance between drama and black humor, dropping the listener in on the arrest of the protagonist and then documenting his ensuing panic attacks behind bars. His concerns vacillate between the laughably mundane (\u201cThey all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost\u201d) and the deadly (\u201cMy cellmate\u2019s\u200b a killer\u201d). But it\u2019s the delivery of the penultimate line of the verse\u2014\u201cThey make me do push-ups in drag\u201d\u2014that reverberates after the song ends. It\u2019s a half-laugh, half-sob delivered with flair and a wink. The scattered references to queerness and gender-play\u2014Gerard might sing a verse from the perspective of a girlish ex-lover\u2014add a counterweight to the record\u2019s overarching violence and masculinity, a self-referential nod to a frontman who would later publicly admit to struggles with gender identity. In a scene that was quickly turning to gendered hatred and dreams of femicide, these small rebellions against the rigidity of masculinity felt like the loosening of a pressure valve.\nBut the song that would become an anthem for fans and the hoards of copycat bands that grew in the album\u2019s wake was lead single, \u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise).\u201d  The song is a comparatively straightforward outsider anthem, with choppy chords, gnarled vocals, and lyrics that state pent-up, vindictive frustration outright. As far as narcissistic depression goes, the chorus is admittedly on-the-nose: \u201cI\u2019m not OK/You wear me out.\u201d With its sensitive, almost sophomoric outlook (\u201cForget about the dirty looks/The photographs your boyfriend took\u201d), the song could have been self-parody, an encapsulation of emo\u2019s self-pitying melodramatics. Yet, perhaps because the band took themselves and their message as deadly serious, \u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise)\u201d remains a classic\u2014an unfiltered stream of pure catharsis, destined to be screamed at karaoke bars for the foreseeable future. From the gasping desperation of Gerard\u2019s vocal performance, recorded alone in a dark attic, to the song\u2019s pop structure, it approached the desolation in its lyrics with almost triumphant glee. Unabashedly melodic and unafraid to whimper and shout in the same verse, \u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise)\u201d captures the most exciting way to be at the end of your rope.\nIn the end, sentiment won out over concept. A year into the tour for the Three Cheers, Gerard began to sing a different tune about the meaning of the record: \u201cReally, it's about two boys living in New Jersey who lost their grandma, and how their brothers in the band helped them get through it.\" And the beauty in Three Cheers lies in that mutability: It took the quotidian drama of suburban kids and blew it up into a life-or-death soap opera. Instead of digging its heels further into the pressures of adolescence, the album attempted to transcend them; in a world of Judy Blumes, it read like Stephen King.\nMy Chemical Romance thrived because they came to the realization that emotional outcasts deserved something to cheer for, even if their victories were imaginary. Teenage emotions aren\u2019t cut and dried and high school has no set heroes and villains. In building a world that reflected imperfections and guilt, exhilaration and depression, My Chemical Romance never patronized their audience; their characters, like the band members themselves, embraced the in-between. Perhaps that is why, when The Daily Mail accused My Chemical Romance of creating a suicidal cult, teens cloaked in the colors of a funeral procession shot back with a surprisingly affirmative response: \u201cMCR SAVED OUR LIVES.\u201d\n", "My Chemical Romance_I Brought You My Bullets": "No Review", "My Chemical Romance_You Brought Me Your Love": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_Lover": "The theme of Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover is right there in the title. These 18 songs are odes to the things she loves most and knows best: her boyfriend and her mom, the West Village and the West End, and, always and forever on a Taylor Swift album, being in love. It\u2019s an exuberant celebration of the challenges of maintaining a relationship through seasons and across continents, of telling the truth and saying sorry. Swift has always mined her personal life for opaque fables of love and retribution; she memorializes a romance\u2019s fleeting details, wraps them in bows, and ferries them to an audience eager to receive her gifts. She writes about a life that\u2019s strengthened, not broken, by heartbreak. Lover is the suggestion that the right person, the right song, might lift heartbreak from your life, too. The concept is, as she claims early on, both \u201coverdramatic and true.\u201d\nLover nods to 2017\u2019s reputation, but in spirit, it\u2019s the sequel to the synth-pop glitter of 1989. Produced mostly with ubiquitous pop whisperer Jack Antonoff, it\u2019s full of low-lying synthesizer pulses and reverbed beats that can feel more like scaffolding than full songs. Sometimes it attempts to honor Swift\u2019s entire artistic journey at once: The waltzing \u201cLover,\u201d full of fiddle and fairytale weddings, harks back to the Old Taylor; \u201cI Think He Knows\u201d is a thumping electro-pop shout-out to Nashville\u2019s Music Row. She uses the word \u201cshade\u201d twice, up from once on reputation. She\u2019s 29, but she still writes metaphors about prom dresses and homecoming queens. It\u2019s bright and fun and occasionally cloying.\nLover\u2019s emotional peaks and valleys are higher and deeper than reputation, where romance played out under a long shadow of doubt. Opener \u201cI Forgot That You Existed\u201d is a hopscotch rhythm set to a rhyme like you\u2019d leave in your nemesis\u2019 yearbook if you were really being honest\u2014which is to say, it doesn\u2019t sound like she forgot for one second. It comes off as throat-clearing, but it opens a stretch of drama-free delights, like the magnetic pink glow of \u201cCruel Summer\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep secrets just to keep you!\u201d) and the crystal-ball clarity of \u201cThe Archer,\u201d with its elegant, Chromatics-esque synthesizer build and self-aware regret: \u201cI cut off my nose just to spite my face/And I hate my reflection for years and years.\u201d The exception is undercooked gender-equality anthem \u201cThe Man,\u201d a song that hilariously, unironically points to Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s playboy image as the height of masculine privilege, and proves that other people shouldn\u2019t write Kesha songs.\nIs it the prickly cotton-candy production or the lyrical detail or the vocal echo or just the event album-ness of it all that keeps Lover in the foreground, song after song? With the possible exception of the steel drums on music-box oddball \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend,\u201d the album never claims any new ground; some of its best moments are unavoidably familiar. Rihanna or Robyn might intend their new music to sound entirely fresh; Swift, our most conventional pop star, builds atop what has worked already. And with Antonoff behind so much of the sound of pop music in the latter half of the decade, the bold, \u201980s-inspired style isn\u2019t inherently more interesting or varied than any other. \u201cI Think He Knows\u201d sounds like Carly Rae Jepsen; \u201cThe Archer\u201d sounds like Lorde\u2019s \u201cSupercut\u201d; \u201cMiss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,\u201d actually a Joel Little joint, sounds like Lana Del Rey\u2019s Born to Die.\nSwift and her collaborators try some real doozies: Pop-punk marriage proposal \u201cPaper Rings\u201d has a key change borrowed from the Shangri-Las and more than a little acoustic guitar in the mix. It\u2019s cute, and then exhausting. The perky, England-themed \u201cLondon Boy\u201d begins sweetly\u2014\u201cI saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent\u201d\u2014but devolves into a parade of rugby and high tea and \u201cI fancy you\u201ds, a love song as predictable as one of Mary-Kate and Ashley\u2019s direct-to-video European adventures. She samples Idris Elba joking about taking James Corden on a scooter ride, apropos of nothing except that he says \u201cLondon.\u201d I can only imagine what it sounds like to a Brit.\n\u201cLondon Boy\u201d is relentlessly upbeat, but the next mood swing will knock you sideways: It\u2019s \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Get Better,\u201d a heartrending ballad about Swift\u2019s mother\u2019s ongoing cancer battle, with background harmonies by the Dixie Chicks. Three minutes later, her tender testimony of new faith is outshined by the terrific \u201cFalse God,\u201d a moody sophistipop meditation on transatlantic romance where worship (\u201cReligion\u2019s in your lips\u2026 the altar is my hips\u201d) sounds more like a metaphor for\u2026. oral sex? On a Taylor Swift album? Am I losing my mind? Then \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d crashes in to remind us that she also considers making nice with Katy Perry to be a form of activism.\nBecause Swift is better when she\u2019s learning than when she\u2019s trying to teach us a lesson, Lover\u2019s garish lead singles contribute to the strain. I\u2019ve thought about \u201cME!\u201d every day for four months; it still sounds like a musical number taken out of context, just unearned celebratory fanfare without plot or character development, so dead-eyed it\u2019s spooky. But she\u2019s better when she gives herself real space to think, as on \u201cCornelia Street,\u201d a lovely, understated tribute to memory and nostalgia with the power to make one rarefied block of Manhattan feel universal.\nLike Red or Speak Now, Lover is a sprawling scrapbook of invisible personal bookmarks, an escapist fantasy about a real-life celebrity boyfriend, a shrewd self-mythology disguised as a benevolent offering. It\u2019s probably five bad songs away from being better than 1989. It\u2019s also a little wiser and more emotionally honest. \u201cI once believed love would be black and white\u2026 I once believed love would be burning red/But it\u2019s golden,\u201d she sings on dreamy pastel closer \u201cDaylight,\u201d replacing the fiery passion of Red with a gentler, more mature understanding of true love as a good idea you don\u2019t want to stop having. Heartbreak can strengthen you; love sustains you. If only all of Lover had the same heart.\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Taylor Swift_reputation": "For a decade, almost everyone agreed on Taylor Swift. She wrote exquisite love songs and scorching, funny takedowns at an age when most people struggle to put together a cogent email. She scattered breadcrumbs and winking clues through her lyrics and liner notes, inviting diehard fans and pop rubberneckers alike to agonize over what was fact and what was fiction. She won so many awards she was ridiculed for the shocked face she made every time her name was called. She was observant and savvy, and if those qualities were spun into a kind of Machiavellian cunning by her critics, it seemed like a good problem to have.\nHow things have changed. The Swift that stands before us in 2017 is beleaguered and defensive, a figure fighting back from public relations problems she largely could\u2019ve avoided. She stepped into back-and-forths with Nicki Minaj and her eternal nemesis Kanye West, when silence would have seemed optimal. She induced the Streisand effect by taking legal action over a barely-read blog post that drew connections between her work and neo-Nazism, a decision that shone a new spotlight on her steadfast apoliticism in an overheated political climate. And to top it all off, she released \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d a petty snarl of a lead single that jumped to No. 1 thanks largely to sheer anticipation. Chart watchers rejoiced when an ascendant Cardi B bumped her from the top slot; Taylor sent flowers.\nIt turns out \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was closer to a red herring than a sign of things to come, a relief given how it neglected most of Swift\u2019s generational gifts. Reputation, her sixth album, isn\u2019t a tuneless vengeance tour\u2014it\u2019s an aggressive, lascivious display of craftsmanship, one that makes 1989 sound like a pit stop on the way to Swift\u2019s full embrace of modern pop. (This is a trip that began the second the bass dropped on her 2012 song \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble.\u201d) She\u2019s largely abandoned effervescence, wonderment, and narrative. Say goodbye to maple lattes and hello to whiskey on ice, to wine spilling in the bathtub, to Old Fashioneds mixed with a heavy hand.\nHer vision of pop, one she realizes with the help of Max Martin and Shellback, and man-of-the-moment Jack Antonoff, is surprisingly maximal: hair-raising bass drops, vacuum-cleaner synths right out of a Flume single, stuttering trap percussion, cyborg backing choirs. Songs like opener \u201c...Ready for It?\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d are glittering monsters held together by Swift\u2019s presence at their center. Her interest in hip-hop and R&B is most apparent in her voice, an instrument that\u2019s been stripped of its signature expressiveness. Her best performances throughout Reputation are defined by cadence and rhythm, not melody: she\u2019s cool, conversational, detached.\nThese particular skills may have been hiding in plain sight\u2014listen to the decade-old \u201cOur Song\u201d and focus on the way she places syllables while rattling off \u201cOur song is a slammin\u2019 screen door!\u201d\u2014but they\u2019ve never been highlighted the way they are here. \u201cDelicate\u201d is built around a muted pulse and a murmured question: \u201cIs it cool that I said all that? Is it chill that you\u2019re in my head? \u2019Cause I know that it\u2019s delicate.\u201d She stretches out the titular compliment on \u201cGorgeous,\u201d making it a fluttering prayer and letting the rest of the line tumble out in its wake. She even manages to hang with Future on the bizarre, compelling \u201cEnd Game,\u201d leaving poor Ed Sheeran in the dust: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be/Drinking on the beach with you all over me.\u201d The old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u2014she\u2019s posted up at a Cozumel cabana with her out-of-office reply: \u201cI bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put \u2019em.\u201d\nHer writing has never been less diaristic or more dependent on dramatic performance. For Swift, plunging head-first into pop has meant leaving behind the short stories on 2008\u2019s Fearless or 2010\u2019s  Speak Now and relying more on snippets of vivid imagery and detail. (\u201cGetaway Car,\u201d a sparkling Antonoff production that sounds like an \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d retread, is a dramatic and enjoyable outlier.) She leans on characters, some old and some new: the unrepentant brat, the swooning dreamer, and the determined, seductive adult. The \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video was prescient in at least one respect: Reputation collects a half-dozen different aspects of Swift and lines them up in a row. You leave the album with a new appreciation for her versatility, for the way the tough-talking schemer of \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d and the infatuated android of \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d can share the same tracklist.\nThe woman who built a career on family-friendly romances like \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cMine\u201d now turns her gaze to the darker side of passion: obsession, jealousy, lust, the loss of control. A lover turns her bed \u201cinto a sacred oasis\u201d on the featherlight \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied,\u201d and she begs her partner to carve their name into her bedpost on \u201cDress,\u201d a panting, shuddering highlight. Swift hasn\u2019t played the romantic na\u00eff since Red, and she delivers all of these lines with palpable confidence and ease. Even lesser material benefits: \u201cSo It Goes...\u201d is replacement-level trap-pop, but it\u2019s hard to shake the thought of her smeared lipstick, of fingernails dug into someone\u2019s back.\nIn any case, these songs are more successful than the tracks that invite the listener to revisit Swift\u2019s public spats. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is the album\u2019s nadir, and \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d violates what you could call Katy\u2019s Law: the mention of \u201creceipts\u201d in your quasi-diss track renders it an embarrassment. Things somehow get less subtle: \u201cHere\u2019s a toast to my reeeeeal friends,\u201d she sneers on \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d just before faking a weepy apology and breaking into cackling laughter. She\u2019s shooting for over-the-top, campy villainy, but it scans as stubborn petulance. Every listener is over this.\nReputation isn\u2019t the failure that seemed possible a month or two ago; it\u2019s full of bulletproof hooks and sticky turns of phrase. But in committing to a more conventional form of superstardom, Swift has deemphasized the skill at the core of her genius. The album ends with \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d a spare, acoustic epilogue for an album made using a lot of synths and computers. It\u2019s equal parts Lisa Loeb and Dashboard Confessional, and she conjures rich scenes with just a handful of lines: a hotel lobby strewn with party detritus, the silent back seat of a cab.\nShe lands the album\u2019s first true knockout punch in the bridge: \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere.\u201d It\u2019s a tiny universe in a dozen words, an economic marvel right up there with old classics like \u201cYou made a rebel of a careless man\u2019s careful daughter,\u201d and, \u201cYou call me up again just to break me like a promise/So casually cruel in the name of being honest.\u201d This song is Swift at her best\u2014not settling scores long past their expiration date but writing the kind of lines reputations are made of.\n", "Taylor Swift_reputation Stadium Tour Surprise Song Playlist": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_reputation (Big Machine Radio Release Special)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_Taylor Swift Karaoke: 1989 (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_1989": "If there\u2019s one thing Taylor Swift wants you to know about her, it is that she once felt deeply uncool. Even as a superstar with best-selling albums, stadium tours, and high-profile friends, she said in 2014 that she had never felt \u201cedgy, cool, or sexy.\u201d Her first four albums hinge on that feeling, full of vivid, sprawling documents of failed romances that left her gasping for air, wondering how to be someone her lovers would miss. She was almost always the one who was in pain, the outsider, the underdog.\nThat changed with 1989. Its predecessor, Red, was the pinnacle of diaristic specificity, an album that blew up the tiny intimate details of her romances into public eulogies. The media surrounding that album critiqued Swift as clingy, boy-obsessed, and vindictive. 1989 is in part Swift\u2019s response to the negative, often sexist, press she\u2019d received. On the album, Swift loses her na\u00efvet\u00e9, dons a sense of unfazed nonchalance, and learns to navigate a world that underappreciated her lyricism and shamed her for dating too many men. She has said that she would work in marketing if she didn\u2019t work in music but, really, she has already been doing both simultaneously and spectacularly.\nFor those who might openly cry while listening to Red, the first listen of 1989 stings of indifference. The album, named after the year she was born, treats heartbreak as if observing a painting on a wall, rather than a feeling she desperately needs to articulate. Grandiose memories of 2 a.m. fights and dancing in refrigerator light are replaced with glossy odes to big cities and weekend flings. Where liner notes of previous albums offered hyper-specific hints about each song\u2019s subject, these tell the story of a generic on-again off-again romance. At the time, Swift temporarily disavowed dating to instead celebrate the power of female friendship and flaunt her celebrity \u201cgirl squad\u201d with extravagant 4th of July parties and a different guest appearance every night of her tour. Yet 1989 is the album that feels least like spending quality time with your best friends.\nStill, there\u2019s an allure to 1989\u2019s escapism. Now the dramas of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (Fearless\u2019 \u201cLove Story\u201d) or 1945 Americana (Red\u2019s \u201cStarlight\u201d) come with lower stakes; her new fantasy world allows for broken hearts to be stored away safely in a drawer. The polished, propulsive synth-pop of album highlight \u201cStyle\u201d showcases it best, with lyrics that celebrate a lustful relationship between people whose most revealing traits are that they would look good together on a movie poster. Is it about a real experience, or is it fiction? \u201cBlank Space\u201d weaponizes Swift\u2019s newfound romantic skepticism: In the accompanying music video, an aristocratic romance deteriorates catastrophically, poisoned by her jealousy and need to control her partner. On Speak Now\u2019s \u201cDear John,\u201d she\u2019d lamented being added to a lover\u2019s \u201clong list of traitors who don\u2019t understand.\u201d Here, she proudly flaunts her own \u201clong list of ex-lovers\u201d who think she\u2019s crazy, adding the sound of a clicking pen to heighten the gleeful melodrama. She looks at the camera almost as much as she does her lover, warning us that she knows what we think of her and she doesn\u2019t care.\nThough Swift\u2019s interest in pop was evident on songs like Red\u2019s \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d and Speak Now\u2019s \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d 1989 was the first time an entire Swift album could exist as party music without slow-burning heartache. These were still love songs, so Swift\u2019s familiar themes peak through\u2014dismissal of doubters, pleas to remember a romance favorably after it ends, and heavy use of one of her favorite words, \u201cforever.\u201d Still, the glitzy sound and ethos provided an entry point for new listeners and a chance for old ones to come up for air, to recognize that everything doesn\u2019t always have to be so serious. It can be just as freeing to shrug in the face of heartache as it is to spell out exactly why and how you were hurt.\n\u201cNew Romantics,\u201d a surging, euphoric song from the deluxe version of the album that was released as a final single, does this particularly well. Swift\u2019s voice is processed and couched in thrilling yelps and sighs, crunchy synth, and galloping drums. After a certain amount of pain, sometimes your best defense is to channel the burning energy of your big hopes and desires into a night of uninhibited hedonism.\nOn Speak Now\u2019s \u201cMean,\u201d Swift told a critic that one day she would be \u201cliving in a big ol\u2019 city,\u201d while he\u2019d never be anything but a washed-up hater. On 1989\u2019s opener \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d she makes good on that promise. She was already famous when she wrote \u201cMean,\u201d of course, but now she sounded like she was \u201cbig enough so you can\u2019t hit me.\u201d The big ol\u2019 city was imaginary; but on 1989, Swift writes and inhabits a fully-realized fantasy of self-reliance, confidence, and ensuing pleasure. Her music was no longer just a diary entry. You can almost hear her winking on every track.\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Taylor Swift_Taylor Swift Karaoke: 1989 (Deluxe Edition)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_Taylor Swift Karaoke: 1989": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_1989 (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_1989 (Deluxe Edition)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_1989 (Big Machine Radio Release Special)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_Red (Deluxe Edition)": "No Review", "Taylor Swift_Red": "In early 2012, Taylor Swift turned in 20 songs to her label for what would become her fourth album, Red. They were all further outgrowths of the pop-country sound she had mastered in her early years, as a teenager finding her voice in the Nashville scene, trying on songs like \u201cTim McGraw\u201d to reflect the starlight over Georgia and the allure and disappointment of romantic love through a lens that was unmistakably hers. As she amassed a body of work for Red, she was still writing songs about love and its fugitive presence, songs about relationships that swelled like an obsessive thought, songs that picked up and enhanced the smallest pixels of intimate detail as if they were scanning security footage in a crime procedural. When she strummed a chord, it shimmered and just hung there. It sounded like Swift, an organic progression from her previous records.\nLooking at the albums that followed Red, it\u2019s obvious Swift longed for the inorganic, to send her songs through the distortions of modern pop and see what kind of genetically-scrambled horror would come back. You can hear it immediately in the first song she wrote in collaboration with pop gurus Max Martin and Shellback, \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d\u2014a mutation is happening. A chord thrums from an acoustic guitar which then turns inside out as it plays, as if caught in the neck of a vacuum. It didn\u2019t sound like the old Taylor Swift, the one who wrote 20 new Taylor Swift songs for a new Taylor Swift album. It sounded like a new version of her, being fitfully born.\nSwift was trying to push her music outside of its traditional boundaries, to stray into the interzone between pop and country. Pop was just beginning to mingle its DNA with EDM; dubstep, a once varied and relatively new branch of dance music, had been reduced to the stomach-flip of the drop just as its popularity in America crested. Martin and Shellback were aware of these shifts in pop\u2019s geography; they incorporated many of them into Femme Fatale, the Britney Spears album from the previous year. One of the other Swift/Martin/Shellback collaborations on Red, \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d starts as a pop-rock song but its edges mimic the queasy wobble of dubstep. Synths scream behind Swift\u2019s voice like mechanical saws. It was as if she had finally found a musical backdrop sharp as her lyrics\u2014the lakes and backroads of Tennessee and Georgia disappear, replaced with formations of jagged crystal, a perfect environment for a song about falling in love with someone you know will hurt you and leave you feeling empty as a canyon.\nRed is an album of disappearances, of things that have gone or are just about to go missing\u2014lost relationships, old sounds, previous Taylor Swifts, each photographed just as they\u2019re receding out of frame. Even on the album cover, Swift is partially disappeared, her downcast eyes swallowed by a lip of shadow falling from a wide-brimmed hat. It\u2019s her somewhat obvious way of referencing the front cover of Joni Mitchell\u2019s 1971 album Blue, where a photograph of Mitchell\u2019s face is submerged a blue-black lake of shadow.\nRed is also the first record where Swift directly echoes Mitchell\u2019s writing, a once potential and hazy inspiration now coming into view. In a counterpoint to the musical wanderlust on display, there\u2019s a newfound patience to Swift\u2019s observations, a knowledge that narratives form out of brokenness and frustrated communication more often than they do out of ease or any emotional clarity. Many of Swift\u2019s earlier, fantasy-driven songs, like \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cMine,\u201d end neatly; both resolved with marriage. But real stories have a way of ending in places uneasy and uncertain, and what seemed to be the most enduring relationships splinter off into loose ends and glass shards. Swift knew this; she described Red in Billboard as being about \u201call the different ways that you have to say goodbye to someone... Every different kind of missing someone, every kind of loss\u2014it all sounds different to me.\u201d\nSo she sought out different producers and collaborators to give shape to these kinds of missing. She wanted the drum sounds that Jeff Bhasker brought to fun.\u2019s 2012 pop album Some Nights, hushed, cottony throbs that sound cobwebbed over. They bloom beneath the skin of \u201cHoly Ground,\u201d a song where Swift discovers a brief connection so glowing and true that she skips over the end of the relationship because it\u2019s not important: \u201cAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way/And the story\u2019s got dust on every page.\u201d \u201cTreacherous,\u201d which she co-wrote with Semisonic\u2019s Dan Wilson, initially sounds like an old Taylor Swift song, but it deepens over time like none of her songs before or since, a masterclass in dynamics from arrangement to lyric. It starts off relatively motionless, frozen in time by all the tension in Swift\u2019s voice, as if by keeping absolutely still she might not fall for the song\u2019s subject. Then the guitars and drums melt into dark, wet echoes like pelting raindrops, as Swift\u2019s focus narrows toward a driveway in the distance: \u201cTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night/And I will get you alone.\u201d\nEven the songs she recorded with Nathan Chapman, the producer of her first three records and the initial 20 songs she turned in for Red, are expanding, sometimes sounding like a bloom of sound from an empty arena. On opener \u201cState of Grace,\u201d guitars chime like sonar, as if trying to measure the diameter of Swift\u2019s feelings: the early blushes of a relationship, when you seem to recognize something in someone else that you\u2019re not certain anyone else has seen. \u201cWe are alone/Just you and me/Up in your room and our slates are clean,\u201d she sings, wiring images into a lattice of memory, \u201cJust twin fire signs/Four blue eyes.\u201d\nIf Red holds together at all as it rockets through hybrid genres, it\u2019s in the attentive way Swift dwells on memory and loss and the effect of time on both. In the liner notes, Swift borrows a quote from a Pablo Neruda poem\u2014\u201cLove is so short, forgetting is so long\u201d\u2014and accordingly, the songs on Red stretch to the length of their forgetting. \u201cSad Beautiful Tragic\u201d sways like a slowcore desert mirage, a Taylor Swift song on the verge of signing to 4AD. \u201cTime is taking its sweet time erasing you,\u201d she sings, while the music simulates that stuttered crawl of days after a breakup, a soft melt of chords that make seconds feel like hours.\n\u201cTime won\u2019t fly/It\u2019s like I\u2019m paralyzed by it,\u201d Swift sings in \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d the centerpiece of Red and potentially her entire career. It might be her own \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d; like Bob Dylan, she sweeps up drifts of time into loosely-chronological piles of images. \u201cThere we are again in the middle of the night,\u201d Swift sings, \u201cWe dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light.\u201d The tenderness with which she observes this moment of intimacy makes it come to life; she reanimates a feeling instead of reacting to it, exploring all the howling negative space a person leaves behind when their shadow recedes\u2014the things you talked about, the kinds of attention you gave each other, the arguments you had, the rooms where you held onto each other desperately.\nA kind of Chekhov\u2019s Scarf that Swift sheds in the first verse reappears in the final verse (\u201cBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week/\u2019Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\u201d) as a metaphor for the continuity of their connection, how feelings persist long after they\u2019ve lost their use. Nothing dies without leaving some trace of itself, she seems to say throughout the length of Red, and in \u201cAll Too Well\u201d she becomes one of those traces\u2014\u201cI was there,\u201d she sings in the chorus. \u201cI remember it all too well.\u201d Swift, like anyone, is a hostage to her own experience, but she\u2019s also capable of being a witness to it, able to see a relationship\u2014even as it shrinks further and further away in her vision\u2014for what it was rather than what it couldn\u2019t be.\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Taylor Swift_Red (Karaoke Version)": "No Review", "Way Yes_Tuna Hair": "No Review", "Way Yes_Tog Pebbles": "No Review", "Way Yes_Walkability": "No Review", "Pusha T_JESUS IS KING": "No Review", "Pusha T_KIDS SEE GHOSTS": "No Review", "Pusha T_ye": "No Review", "Pusha T_The Life Of Pablo": "No Review", "Pusha T_Yeezus": "No Review", "Pusha T_Kanye West Presents Good Music Cruel Summer": "No Review", "Pusha T_Watch The Throne (Deluxe)": "No Review", "Pusha T_Watch The Throne": "No Review", "Pusha T_My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy": "No Review", "Pusha T_808s & Heartbreak": "No Review", "Pusha T_Graduation (French Limited Version)": "No Review", "Kanye West_Melly vs. Melvin": "No Review", "Kanye West_We All Shine": "With a trill, the 19-year-old warble rapper YNW Melly can make a death knell sound like a lullaby or inflate a petty breakup into an epic tragedy. At the age of 16, Melly, from an unincorporated spot along Florida\u2019s eastern shore, started uploading his pastel trap songs to SoundCloud, becoming a small-town sensation before spending a year in jail for firing a gun near a high school. Behind bars, he started to take rap more seriously, writing his best song, \u201cMurder on My Mind,\u201d a stunning prison log that morphs during its second act into an intimate exchange. Melly\u2019s power comes from converting solemnity into enthusiasm, making sweet things of sour situations.\nMelly exists a world away from the rap of Southern Florida, specifically the lo-fi, bass-boosted behemoths of Broward County. His music is less actively aggressive in sound, if not content. Sometimes his ghoulish melisma resembles Trippie Redd\u2019s, while some of his flows and melodies feel indebted to Lil Uzi Vert. He\u2019ll dip in and out of melodic phrases like Young Thug. A true child of SoundCloud, he is most interested in hitting the right note. Last year, on his debut mixtape, I Am You, he turned casual terrors into buoyant songs. He interpolated Chris Brown\u2019s \u201cSay Goodbye\u201d for a tune called \u201cSlang That Iron\u201d and sometimes veered from home invasions to amorous gestures. There is a tenderness to his singing that even lends a fragility\u2014a beauty\u2014to his threats of violence.\nWe All Shine sounds more polished than I Am You, slightly more braced. There is an enhanced fidelity, giving his voice more shape and tracing his runs with more precision. At points, he sounds like he could open for the B2K reunion tour. He sings about hundred-round drums and twerkers, on songs like \u201cRolling Loud,\u201d with the same passion that R&B heartthrobs use to profess their love to their sweethearts.\nBut while he was smoothing his tunes, his writing lost some bite. None of the songs here match the heights of their predecessors: the vivid imagery in \u201cMurder on My Mind,\u201d the sobering introspection of \u201cMama Cry,\u201d or the rousing salvos of \u201cVirtual (Blue Balenciagas).\u201d His collaboration with Kanye West, \u201cMixed Personalities,\u201d should be a banner moment for an unsigned artist like Melly; their duet characterizes lovers as bipolar for simply ignoring their calls, and it is almost painfully unremarkable. (Kanye, who announced that he was bipolar by scrawling it on the ye cover and called the disorder his \u201csuperpower,\u201d is dismissive of it here.) He\u2019ll occasionally wander backward into a clever idea (\u201cI just found out a new ingredient to death/I\u2019ma give it all \u2019til it ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 left\u201d), and he\u2019s capable of dressing up some pretty bugged-out images. The most interesting thing he does here is write a diss track for his bank.\nWe All Shine is a regression in his development as a storyteller. \u201cNo Holidays\u201d takes his most poignant jail revelations from \u201cMurder on My Mind\u201d and flattens them out until he\u2019s rapping about jacking off in his cell, lining up for lunch, and wearing Gildan T-shirts. His observations from the inside come across as mundane. To be fair, jail by its very nature is mundane, but his potential hinges on his ability to bring a touch of the extraordinary to ordinary circumstances, to sing black and white into color. Previous prison dispatches imagined all Melly was missing on the outside, but this tape lacks that outward-looking, illustrative quality.\nMelly was originally pegged as a serenader, though reports of his balladry have been somewhat exaggerated. He hasn\u2019t penned anything quite like \u201cTrap Queen\u201d or \u201cI Be U,\u201d and the closest he gets to romance is offering to \u201clend\u201d a city girl his love. But there is a warmth to his best music that feels sentimental, and it is there that We All Shine is transporting. The infectious \u201cCurtains (Burtains)\u201d reimagines Young Nudy flows with more robust croons. \u201cControl Me\u201d has the same 1990s R&B bounce as some of the most catchy Kamaiyah songs, with choice words of post-millennial intimacy: \u201cI would never look on your post or your messages,\u201d he sings, as if reciting wedding vows. When YNW Melly is on, it seems like he can make any banal string of words pop. Listening closely to We All Shine, however, proves just how much his writing must be the glue that holds it all together.\n", "Kanye West_I AM YOU": "No Review", "The Weekend_Black Panther The Album Music From And Inspired By": "No Review", "The Weekend_Ctrl": "No Review", "The Weekend_Z": "No Review", "Slowdive_Slowdive": "Nature metaphors come so readily to mind when listening to shoegaze\u2014clouds, stars, skies, storms, oceans, whirlwinds, maelstroms\u2014that it\u2019s easy to believe that, like the weather it evokes, it just sort of happens. Invest in the right guitar pedals, put the right breathy spin on your vocals, and bam\u2014instant Loveless, or close enough to fool a stoned and heartsick teenager. It\u2019s as easy as walking out your front door and letting the spring air greet you.\nFor some bands that may well be all there is to it. But song by song, moment by moment, sometimes even note by note, Slowdive do\u00a0it better. There\u2019s nothing elaborate in the bassline for \u201cSlomo,\u201d the opening track of their first album in 22 years, given the thick bed of guitars it bounces on. Just seven notes, the sixth of which leaps unexpectedly up an octave instead of continuing the bassline\u2019s descent. Or at the end of \u201cSlomo,\u201d when Rachel Goswell\u2019s voice pulls off a similar trick, first when she takes over lead vocals from Neil Halstead, then when she starts singing them at the very top of her register. At the end of \u201cGo Get It,\u201d Halstead sings two different lyrics laid on top of one another simultaneously, like his conversation with Goswell is over and now he's talking to himself.\nIn a genre beloved for its comfortable reliability, all it takes are these small but striking detours to remind us that this glorious noise is the work of human hands and the skill that move them. If there\u2019s a story to Slowdive\u2014the band\u2019s return to active recording together after decades of slowly mounting critical and audience acclaim\u2014beyond the human-interest angle of the return itself, the swerves in the songcraft tell it: This is an album as thoughtful as it is beautiful.\nYou can hear the attention to detail even in the album\u2019s most conventionally pop songs. Knockout single \u201cSugar for the Pill\u201d and \u201cNo Longer Making Time\u201d share a similar structure, matching a loping alt-rock bassline with high arpeggiated guitar. But the differences that emerge within that framework are fascinating. \u201cSugar\u201d avoids the go-for-the-throat, quiet-loud-quiet format which \u201cNo Longer\u201d embraces, opting instead for a subdued sophistipop chorus that matches the resignation of its central lyric: \u201cYou know it\u2019s just the way things are.\u201d The latter song may lack the former\u2019s restraint, but it makes up for it with the tightest, loveliest vocal harmonies on the album from singer-guitarists Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell, plus a fake-out finale that reintroduces the opening riff so deftly you\u2019ll wonder if you hit repeat by accident.\nDrummer Simon Scott, returning to the fold for the first time on record since 1993\u2019s shoegaze opus Souvlaki, emerges as a key element not just for the songs\u2019 drive, but of their texture. On \u201cSlomo,\u201d \u201cNo Longer Making Time,\u201d and \u201cGo Get It,\u201d he provides not so much a backbeat as a frontbeat, a\u00a0sound to be reckoned with, not taken for granted. Scott also helped create the vocal and piano loops that comprise \u201cFalling Ashes,\u201d the album\u2019s closer; the repetition transforms Halstead and Goswell\u2019s refrain of \u201cThinkin\u2019 about love\u201d from soggy sentiment into something that actually forces you to think about love as you listen. Even when Scott plays a more traditional role, as with the martial tempo he provides for the opening minute of \u201cDon\u2019t Know Why,\u201d he\u2019s apt to shift the rhythm beneath the Halstead/Goswell/Christian Savill guitars in unpredictable ways.\nSlowdive\u00a0offers maximum-volume shoegaze too, better than the band ever has before. Lead single \u201cStar Roving\u201d lives up to its interstellar title with easily the largest, most high-velocity guitar attack in the group\u2019s discography. \u201cGo Get It\u201d is even better: a wet hot summer groove with a savagely flashy riff to match Halstead and Goswell\u2019s back-and-forth chorus of \u201cI wanna see it/I wanna feel it.\u201d The words evoke Iggy and the Stooges\u2019 \u201cGimme Danger\u201d in how they can be interpreted as a quest for spiritual, psychological, or sexual transcendence, depending on your mood. An album this consistently shifty and surprising will likely hit three buttons at some point or other.\nAbout a quarter-century removed from the\u00a0\u201cThe Scene That Celebrates Itself\u201d and the music press that made it infamous, Slowdive reveals what a Slowdive free of that pressure can do. The result isn\u2019t the youthful explosion of their first full-length Just for a Day, nor the polished shot at success of Souvlaki, nor the thrillingly reactionary minimalism of Pygmalion. It\u2019s the work of a band that reformed and recorded by choice, at their own pace, bringing the accrued experience of their entire adult lives to bear on music made outside the crucible for the very first time; no wonder the album, like their debut EP, is self-titled. So forget the weather imagery. Slowdive doesn\u2019t make it look easy. It makes it look hard. Creating music this great almost always is.\n", "Slowdive_Pygmalion": "Swooning, washed-out rock from over a decade ago: Why should these reissues matter? The obvious answer: because this band still sounds incredible. Listening back, it feels like Slowdive were both the first and last word on this particular form of guitar-pop dreaming. It's the same sense you can get from Galaxie 500, Mazzy Star, My Bloody Valentine, or the Cocteau Twins, four bands with whom Slowdive have plenty in common. The 1980s were full of earthy rock from punk's tail end, full of glittery pop and bouncy indie and spandexed anthems-- these people all pitched in to the reverse process of guitar music going slow, slurry, and stylish, going silent-cool, and staring off into space.\nLoads of acts still work along these woozy, languorous lines, and loads of acts traced the lines out before these turn-of-the-90s groups came along. But each of those artists staked out a patch of territory that feels definitive, a sound complete enough that there's no point following down its path. (Who in the world would think he could squeeze more out of Mazzy Star's tricks than Mazzy Star already did?) No, revisiting these bands is a little like trading in some modern guitar-pop for a Beatles record: The first shot doesn't sound dated, or less sophisticated, and it doesn't necessarily seem \"better,\" or more original, either. It's just a workable, fully-formed thing on its own, which might be why most of the acts that feel like Slowdive today-- say, Ladytron, Lali Puna, Broadcast, or M83-- are coming at that mood and atmosphere from very different directions.\nA year ago, we were saying roughly the same thing about Catch the Breeze, a Slowdive compilation that was more Portable Summary than Best Of. Two discs, packed with long stretches from the band's three albums and most of the highlights from their singles and EPs-- this was a big enough chunk of their five-year career to make it easy to take a pass on the rest. Now comes the complete follow-through: remastered reissues of all three LPs, in full. The first two, Just for a Day and Souvlaki, come in the now-standard two-disc format, packaged with a lot of the same extras that already wound up on the compilation; the last, 1995's long out-of-print Pygmalion, comes back to life in its original form, which is probably the best and biggest news here. Yeah, yeah: Reissues, duplication, hard-earned money, blah blah blah. But in the long term, all those kids you see picking their noses everywhere will have two solid options for investigating this band-- the short way or the long one.\nThe gist of it: Frontman Neil Halstead has remained the same kind of songwriter throughout his career, from Slowdive's shoegazing to Mojave 3's dreamy \"country\" (someone did try to beat Mazzy Star!) to his solo folk; his songs are warm, uncomplicated, full of some strange weepy longing, and slowed down to a narcotic drawl. What's surprising is how many different ways he's found to present them. The best starting point is 1993's Souvlaki, already a bit of an Essential Slowdive in itself. Across this record, the band kicks up a swirl that matches Halstead's sleepwalking pop perfectly: Guitars stretch and swirl in slow-motion layers, and the vocals seem to be calling desperately out of them, even when they're just lazy chants. This stuff manages to be both pillowy-soft and passionately deep-- shades of the way My Bloody Valentine could blur heaviness into an out-of-focus lull, or the way Galaxie 500's drowsy strum could come out with a fist in the air.\nA significant chunk of Souvlaki wound up on Catch the Breeze, but anyone hoping the remainder was forgettable is out of luck: Even as collaborator Brian Eno led this album off into a few dub-deep explorations, Halstead's pop songwriting hit a peak, and the album's tracks wound up good-as-\"Alison\" almost straight across. (Same goes for the cover of \"Some Velvet Morning\" on the bonus disc-- just Slowdive putting the swirl on someone else's dreamy, narcotic country songwriting.) It's a slightly different scenario for the band's first album, 1991's Just for a Day, which the anthology ignored in favor of the early singles and radio sessions that now stock its bonus disc. Not so surprising: It's a straight line from those singles and EPs to the sound of Souvlaki, whereas Just for a Day is more of a sweet-dream detour. It was in 1991 that the NME said Slowdive could \"make Cocteau Twins resemble Mudhoney,\" and the fluffy sprawl of this record seems to be trying to prove them right. There's a lot less weight to it, and if anything in Slowdive's catalogue will seem dated, it's the overgroomed production on these songs. Still, there's something terrifically oceanic about it-- tracks start out softly floating and then whip themselves up into gorgeous, overbearing squalls.\nMost important, though, is the reissue of Pygmalion, which should knock down the album's eBay asking price by a good fifty bucks. This is a detour of the best sort, and a Slowdive album in name only: With this record, Halstead pushed the rest of the band to the sidelines, dropped the notion of a \"band\" altogether, and recorded at least two tracks that I can't imagine being rivaled-- ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride. Some of it is all woozy layers: spare touches of guitar, vocal phrases looping and phasing around one another, slow-rolling sampled drums. Some of it takes on the warmth and empty-room minimalism of the \"folk\" Halstead would go on to make. More than just \"some\" of it appears on Catch the Breeze-- five tracks out of nine, from an album that's not exactly consistent.

They serve a touchstone for electronic producers interested in apparitional mystery and their music gets placed in movies when directors are looking for a shortcut to beatific beauty. Conversely, with the exception of the Animal Collective-styled \u201cGobbledigook,\u201d not one Sigur R\u00f3s song has suggested a contemporary outside influence. But they'd become trapped by their singularity: By 2008\u2019s gluttonously orchestrated Me\u00f0 su\u00f0 \u00ed eyrum vi\u00f0 spilum endalaust, they appeared stuck in an escalating arms race with their past work and on last year\u2019s Valtari, Sigur R\u00f3s didn\u2019t feel like a human entity anymore, just a collection of textural signifiers that confirmed their critics\u2019 view of them as credible New Age.\nValtari sounded like a dead end, and it did turn out to be the end of Sigur R\u00f3s as we knew them. After the breakup rumors subsided, the band lost keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson\u00a0and signed with a new label. Returning with unexpected speed and unprecedented vitality, Kveikur is the big payback; a bracing record of pummeling post-rock, eerie hauntology and concentrated pop splendor,\u00a0Sigur R\u00f3s finally acknowledge their impact by beating all of their acolytes at their own game.\nThat Kveikur translates to \u201ccandlewick\u201d and phonetically sounds like \u201cquake\u201d is appropriate, as Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019 seventh album is their most explosive and action-packed. Perhaps it\u2019s to compensate for the departure of Sveinsson, or maybe bassist Georg Holm and drummer\u00a0Orri P\u00e1ll D\u00fdrason are just tired of getting 0% of the credit over the past decade and a half. Either way, Kveikur is defined by its rhythm section, even as it wisely repositions J\u00f3nsi's\u00a0inimitable vocals as the focus, back where they belong after being used as mostly texture on Valtari.\nAfter the ambient bubble bath of Valtari, the deep drum hits within the first minute of \u201cBrennisteinn\u201d disrupt Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019 artistic stasis like a cannonball; the heavy metal churn takes on a metaphorical and symbolic aspect, as if signifying Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019 transformation from an inanimate object into a vengeful, destructive Decepticon. From there on out, Sigur R\u00f3s are fully committed to stress testing their sound. Whenever the distorted bass lunges on the title track, it sounds like it\u2019s trying to drill oil from the ocean floor. The feedback shrieks throughout \u201cBrennisteinn\" feel elegant and sleek rather than abrasive, like fine cutlery on black marble instead of nails on a chalkboard. \u201cHrafntinna\u201d is a metal song in a literal sense, composed of fractured cymbals, sonorous brass, the whinny of horsehair on steel guitar strings; over its six minutes, there\u2019s a filmic, storytelling quality that shows J\u00f3nsi could and should be doing soundtrack work for movies with more heft than We Bought A Zoo.\nBut Sigur R\u00f3s always had the frame for heavy metal muscle-- let\u2019s not forget this is a band who makes 10-minute songs with elfin vocals from a guy who wears a fringed jacket and plays his guitar with a cello bow. For all their ethereal beauty, Agaetis Byrjun and ( ) are heavy records. This isn\u2019t Sigur R\u00f3s all of a sudden donning Viking helmets and playing out dry-ice fantasies like Robert Plant in\u00a0The Song Remains the Same-- Think of it along the lines of Boards of Canada\u2019s Tomorrow\u2019s Harvest or Portishead\u2019s Third without the attendant hype-stoking hiatus,\u00a0reacting to the impossible standards set by their groundbreaking early work (as well as a reputation for being chillout fare), by exposing their gnarled roots and demonic impulses.\nFor example, what if the distended howl of Agaetis Byrjun was distilled into the percussive clatter of Takk\u2019s \u201cGong\u201d and concentrated shoegaze swirl of \u201cMe\u00f0 bl\u00f3\u00f0nasir\u201d? It might produce something like \u201c\u00cdsjaki\", where D\u00fdrason's drums continuously push J\u00f3nsi\u2019s call and response vocals to new ecstatic spaces between disco pleasure and black metal pain. Combine the electronic-pop momentum of J\u00f3nsi\u2019s Go with the imperial marches of Me\u00f0 su\u00f0\u00a0of and the result is the \u201cRafstraumur\", a reminder that Sigur R\u00f3s can still go goosebump-for-goosebump with M83 and Coldplay if they so choose.\nIt\u2019s one thing for a complete sonic overhaul to be necessary, but what stands out about\u00a0Kveikur is how natural it feels. As opposed to a rebranding, this is Sigur R\u00f3s internally reconstituted, where the biggest addition isn\u2019t distorted guitars or huge drums or J\u00f3nsi going full tilt. More than sounds, this is an integration of new verbs and actions, as Sigur R\u00f3s pummel, rage, wail and assert, asking hard questions of themselves. What if they could harness their power to convey immediate anger instead of patient catharsis, as a soundtrack for lifting weights instead of zoning out? J\u00f3nsi\u2019s vocals will always bear an extraterrestrial shimmer, but why can\u2019t he play the avenging archangel rather than a friendly ghost? After 15 years of evoking Iceland's gorgeous, volcanic terrain and woodsprite legends, why not reflect the endless winters, cratered economy and the frightening suicide rate?\nEven if it doesn\u2019t have the same cultivated mystery or incapacitating demands of\u00a0Agaetis Byrjun or\u00a0( ), Kveikur is every bit a return to form, tapping into its predecessors\u2019 bottomless emotional wellspring for a Sigur R\u00f3s album that can be listened to casually or intensely, a collection that works as effectively as a spiritual experience and pop music, the essence of their overwhelming, widescreen grandeur conveyed with the immediacy of a 50-minute rock record.\n", "Sigur Ros_Valtari": "Let's start with an understatement: things tend to move quite slowly in the world of Sigur R\u00f3s. This is true whether we're talking about the glacial pace of their songs, the glacial pace at which they release them, or their artistic progression. In the 13 years since \u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun became the first and possibly only post-rock crossover record, Sigur R\u00f3s have edged closer to actual pop while still maintaining their singular place amongst many consumers' record collections: The band's stamp of approval is pretty much the only way a lot of people are dealing with 10-minute songs or an invented language. It's a tremendous example of a band that's managed to own its lane while making it incrementally wider, and their consistently positive reception gives you the idea that the only way Sigur R\u00f3s could make a bad record is if they made one that was wholly unrecognizable as their own. Well, you won't confuse Valtari as being the work of anyone else, if only because their sixth studio album so flattens and narrows Sigur R\u00f3s' aesthetic to the point where the title scans as self-parody. \"Valtari\" is Icelandic for \"steamroller,\" by the way.\n\"It sounds corny, but when I listen to it, it puts images in my head. I feel like I'm walking up a mountain alone.\" This is how bassist Georg Holm recently described Valtari to Rolling Stone, and I find that to be interesting on two fronts, the initial being there's a good chance you had no idea that Sigur R\u00f3s had a bassist, let alone what his name is. All too ironic that it's perhaps the only time Holm makes any sort of statement on Valtari, which unfortunately gives weight to the unfair perception of Sigur R\u00f3s as J\u00f3nsi and anonymous conjurers. It's a disappointment and a missed opportunity, since after the release of 2005's vibrant Takk--\u00a0still their most diverse and consistently accessible record-- the most interesting music Sigur R\u00f3s have made is relative to their implementation of rhythm, culminating with 2008's clodhopping Animal Collective homage \"Gobbledigook\" and J\u00f3nsi's hypercolored solo album,\u00a0Go. It's debatable whether the rhythm section was jettisoned in the composition stages or whether they're simply rendered immobile under thick layers of orchestral amber. Either way,\u00a0Valtari forgoes the promising lean toward pop songcraft of their recent LPs and the volcanic dynamics of their earliest material with only pretty vacancy as a replacement.\nAbout two minutes into Valtari, J\u00f3nsi's vocals rise out of a brackish pool of strings, choirs, and piano to tease out a melody. About two minutes later, there's a small rupture of distorted bowed guitars and organ, and two minutes after that, it glides to a serene denouement. That describes opener \"\u00cag Anda\" and also basically more than half of Valtari, leaving you to fashion highlights out of relativity. The positive side of Valtari's four-year incubation period is evidenced by \"Var\u00fa\u00f0\", the way it effortlessly combines\u00a0waterlogged piano chords and a brassy fanfare. Yet while the cymbal-bashing crescendo it builds toward is the most viscerally rewarding thing here, anyone familiar with the past decade of Sigur R\u00f3s has heard it dozens of times.\nWhich brings me back to \"it puts images in my head.\" The evocative nature of Sigur R\u00f3s' music has always been a major draw, but I think the more telling part of Holm's quote is \"I feel like I'm walking up a mountain.\" Indeed, due to Sigur R\u00f3s' unwillingness to exert any sort of artistic will on the listener, Valtari feels like work, a trudge, asking for too much by way of demanding nothing concrete. Even the controversially blank () had staunch conviction in its commitment to supernatural ethereality-- not to mention subtly impressive melodies and some of their most unsettling peaks. If you're familiar only with Sigur R\u00f3s' studio albums, you might hear Valtari as a maximalist version of ()-- which would essentially negate the entire point of (). Too loud to truly pass for ambient music, yet too invertebrate to accommodate visceral pleasures, Valtari is most often simply\u00a0there, the passage of time distinguished only by the occasional shift in texture. The drum sounds that close out \"Rembihn\u00fbtur\" are a nice touch and establish a possible connection between Sigur R\u00f3s and the likes of Balam Acab, as do the gamelan-like, detuned bells of the title track. But if you get to that point, J\u00f3nsi all but disappears on the final two tracks, and consequently, Valtari's tether to sounding like Sigur R\u00f3s rather than indistinct audio Calgon.\nI suppose it's always worth remembering to review what you got as opposed to what you wanted, and as J\u00f3nsi explained to Q magazine, \"the music kind of just rolls over you\u2026 in a good way.\" So it can all sound incredibly grumpy to take issue with Valtari\u00a0for\u00a0staying in cruise control, no different from criticizing a day at the beach for being too hot. Well, if we're gonna continue down the path of that metaphor for Sigur R\u00f3s' longest-gestating record, it's more like the first beach day of the year and you find out you can't go surfing, can't throw a Frisbee, can't start a bonfire, can't even go in the ocean. The problem isn't that Valtari aspires to beauty, even if it's a commonplace, celestial understanding of it. Sigur R\u00f3s have proven they can make indelible music that's pretty and unpredictable, pretty and melodic, pretty and unnerving, pretty and inspiring. Valtari wants to be pretty and that's it.\n", "Sigur Ros_Inn\u00ed": "Inni arrived in stores with plenty to keep Sigur R\u00f3s fans occupied-- over two hours of music spread across two discs, as well as a handsomely shot DVD-- but last week, there was a piece of unintentional bonus material capable of changing its context completely after the fact: news that the band was back in the studio. Save for one track that ended up on the cutting room floor, Inni was taken from the band's final show in London before their indefinite hiatus and the launch of Jonsi's solo career, the success of which was a foregone conclusion. So it was easy to see Inni as an attempt at a totemic, final word on the Icelandic group or at least a 4Q sweep at completist dollars. As of now, it still does maintain something of a sense of finality, but only as a smartly arranged retrospective of a rewarding decade that began with an unprecedented sound and ended up with the sense that complete ownership of that sound had people taking them for granted.\nThough basically any concert performance from Sigur R\u00f3s has been considered transcendent due to its underlying material, both of their live documents have had some sort of distinguishing characteristic. 2007's Heima stripped them down to acoustic essentials and Windham Hill vibes, the novelty manifesting in how closely they were willing to lean into their accusations of being New Age For Radiohead Fans. Here, you bear witness to the closest incarnation of Sigur R\u00f3s as a rock band comprised of human beings who play stringed instruments you could buy at Target as opposed to some sort of mythic conjurers-- they didn't bring closely associated string quartet Amiina, a horn section, or a choir, or anything that lumped them into the \"prog\" category outside of song lengths that regularly top eight minutes.\nBut the lack of literal bells and whistles could've been more out of convenience than a desire to make any sort of artistic point. Thanks to J\u00f3nsi's impeccable vocals, a rare falsetto that loses none of its power in a live setting, everything remains indubitably the work of Sigur R\u00f3s. Peeling off a few brassy layers isn't going to reveal any sort of true pop songcraft that you might've missed. Likewise, Inni will only be disappointing if you consider a live version as the de facto \"real version\" due to some strict concept of authenticity-- turns out that knowing when and how to employ a horn section is a skill and one the band excels at, so it's understandable that \"N\u00fd Batter\u00ed\" and \"Hopp\u00edpola\" don't max out quite as volcanically as they do on record.\u00a0 And if we're being honest, do we really want their back catalog to be humanized? I've always enjoyed \"Med Bl\u00f3dnasir\" as the three rapturous minutes where Sigur R\u00f3s thought they were a shoegaze band, but does hearing it sped up to a near punk-rock velocity, flubbed bass notes and all, add any real value? And while a gorgeous, dew-drop piano ballad on its own accord, \"All Alright\" doesn't definitively answer whether \u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun would be every bit as cherished had it been in English, or any identifiable language for that matter.\nBut this format does establish commonality between the five studio albums Inni draws from\u00a0and makes the sequencing and pacing spot-on. This isn't easy to do since none of them really do a good job in terms of substituting for each other. Still, they heavily favor the material that came after 2005's Takk, a crucial pivot where Sigur R\u00f3s started to be slotted into what might be considered \"conventional\" songwriting, or at least transcendence doled out more succinctly and frequently. Even when removed from its amniotic cocoon, \"Svefn-G-Englar\" moves tectonically, its cathartic, minor key rupture lasting about 20 seconds on a track that's got 10 more minutes. Fast forward five years, and \"Hopp\u00edpola\" sounds like the most anthemic part of Snow Patrol's \"Run\" isolated for reproduction in a Petri dish, while \"Vid Spilum Endalaust\" could pass for one of the most instantly catchy songs from either Mew or Muse.\nStill, even if Sigur R\u00f3s do plan on picking back up, Inni rewards those ruthlessly evaluating it based on whether it's a legit substitute for the real thing. Its purchase price is within the range of a face-value concert ticket, but the truth is, I find no reason to begrudge anyone who'd prefer Inni, much like I don't hold it against people who'd rather watch an NFL game in the comfort of their own home, considering the ratio of awe-inspiring catharsis to buildup. After all, the 15 minutes of \"Popplagid\" (aka \"Untitled 8\") are an investment when you've elected to consume *( ) *in its entirety, but here you have to evaluate whether it's worth taking up space that more viscerally satisfying songs like \"Gobbledigook\" or \"Gong\" could've filled.\u00a0 Practically anyone can admit that two consecutive hours of Sigur\u00a0R\u00f3s\u00a0is a lot to take in, and if you need to take a bathroom break or check your Fantasy Football lineup after \"E-Bow\" closes out the first disc, there's no shame in that. After all, if the point of Inni is to prove that Sigur R\u00f3s are human, why can't we be given the same luxury in their presence?\n", "Sigur Ros_Inni (Live)": "No Review", "Sigur Ros_Me\u00f0 su\u00f0 \u00ed eyrum vi\u00f0 spilum endalaust": "In the near-decade since their 1999 breakthrough \u00c1g\u00e6tis Byrjun, Iceland's Sigur R\u00f3s have made pathos their playground.

Just when she and her band Alabama Shakes were branded as innocuous roots-rock revivalists after their 2012 debut, Boys & Girls, she started pushing their retro-soul sound to its outer reaches and beyond. Sound & Color, from 2015, sprawled out into blues and funk and psychedelia, and won three Grammys doing it. Amid the Shakes\u2019 growing popularity, Howard deviated from the course. In 2018, emotionally spent, she called a meeting of her Shakes bandmates to announce that she\u2019d be stepping away for a bit after a spell of writer\u2019s block; she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be doing next, but she\u2019d be doing it on her own. In retreating from Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard found herself on a voyage of self-discovery.\nFrom that process comes her solo debut, Jaime, which is full of that same restless energy. Unlike her work with her bands\u2014including the amped-up rock group Thunderbitch and the alt-country outfit Bermuda Triangle\u2014it speaks solely to the life she\u2019s led, the love and hatred she\u2019s faced, and the way they\u2019ve shaped her worldview. Jaime is a daring turn in just about every way imaginable: bolder, freakier, riskier, more experimental, not just deeply personal but cuttingly political, sometimes quietly tender, sometimes brutally direct. Working in a greenhouse in Topanga Canyon, she mined her complicated personal history, first writing out a memoir of her life up until the founding of Alabama Shakes, then transposing it to songwriting. Howard has said that she needed to be in full control to make this record, and it\u2019s easy to see why: It is the kind of soul-baring opus that first requires soul-searching.\nThe album is named after Howard\u2019s sister, who died at 13 after being diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer. It was Jaime who first taught Brittany to write a song, and now she\u2019s writing her most unyielding and vulnerable ones, songs about coming to terms with personal identity, guarded secrets, spiritual and social and sexual awakenings, deep-rooted family traumas. Though Howard feels united with her sister\u2019s spirit, the album isn\u2019t about Jaime. Instead, it is a boundless study of inner character, someone so used to speaking for others\u2014the Shakes as a unit, the struggling masses on songs like \u201cHold On\u201d\u2014finally taking the opportunity to speak for herself.\nJaime is the sound of Howard coming up for air, getting to know herself better, coming to terms with her place in the world, and then proudly standing in that truth. The songs may be rooted in the same vintage soul that powers Alabama Shakes, but they reach for greater heights and greater depths: convention-defying funkadelia, throwback rap breakbeats, streaking synth-rock, the tense jazz behind D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Black Messiah, the eclectic vocal power of Prince. As Howard breaks all the rules, some songs super busy, others bare, she finds her way home.\nThe mastery of Jaime is balancing the beauty of Southern identity and culture with what Howard has referred to as \u201call the ugly things about the past,\u201d both personally and historically. Howard is a queer, mixed-race woman, born to a black father and white mother in the same city as the founder of neo-Nazi message board Stormfront and a former Grand Wizard in the Klan. It\u2019d be easiest to condemn the place itself outright, but it\u2019s still her home. The saying goes: \u201cThose who don\u2019t know history are doomed to repeat it,\u201d and on \u201cHistory Repeats,\u201d she echoes that sentiment: \u201cWe defeat ourselves.\u201d In studying her own past, she finds reasons to keep fighting for change.\n\u201cI am dedicated to oppose those whose will is to divide us and who are determined to keep us in the dark ages of fear,\u201d Howard chants on \u201c13th Century Metal,\u201d amid a cacophonous, white-knuckle, one-take jam session. The song is full of positive affirmations, and though she reveals herself to be as weary as the rest of us, she won\u2019t stop: \u201cI don\u2019t know about you/But I\u2019m tired of this bullshit/And I wanna try/To do the best that I can.\u201d Amid the noise and chaos, Howard shows that love can be the most radical tool of resistance.\nEven the love songs on Jaime feel like powerful political acts; not just because they revolve around queer love, but because it feels defiant to choose to love and be loved when you\u2019re surrounded by hate. The sweetly skittish \u201cGeorgia,\u201d sung with a flushed breathlessness, is written from the perspective of a young girl with a harmless crush on an older girl. The bluesy \u201cStay High\u201d is about wanting to live in a single moment with a lover forever; the minimalist \u201cShort and Sweet\u201d is about knowing that time is finite, and savoring it. On the former, she lets her voice drift weightlessly skyward; on the latter, her words flit between acoustic strums, like the wick of a candle in an evening breeze. The only thing centering this album is Howard\u2019s remarkable voice, a miraculous instrument of subtlety and power.\nHoward uses this versatility to ask: Why is all this hate and bigotry still happening? The fidgety piano-masher \u201cGoat Head\u201d poses rhetorical questions about a hate crime committed against her father when she was a baby. The story, later recounted to Howard by her mother, lifted the veil on a childhood filled with racism. The song is an unflinching vignette illustrating life as a mixed family among an unforgiving community. \u201cMy mama was brave/To take me outside/\u2019Cause mama is white/And daddy is black/When I first got made/Guess I made these folks mad,\u201d she howls. Many of those \u201cfolks\u201d that were mad then are still mad today, and \u201cTomorrow\u201d wonders aloud what must happen to enact change now: \u201cWe always talk about tomorrow/But now that we\u2019re here/Without lifting a finger/How do you feel?\u201d Her writing is always collected, naked in the way it presents the truth.\nHoward wrote and composed all of the music on Jaime, which manages to sound both far-reaching and solitary. She played all the assorted, mesmerizing guitar parts, and enlisted Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell, jazz pianist extraordinaire Robert Glasper, keyboardist Dan Horton, and drummer Nate Smith to play sessions with her. With these highly capable ringers driving the arrangements, Howard pushes the boundaries of sound and space in search of fulfillment and decency. In a world that requires so much fixing, the music works effortlessly. Armed with a deeper understanding of self, Jaime becomes her gospel of empathy. \u201cI promise\u2026to be wary of who I give my energy to. Because it is needed for a greater cause,\u201d she vows on \u201c13th Century Metal.\u201d \u201cAnd that cause is to spread the enlightenment of love, compassion, and humanity to those who are not touched by its light.\u201d\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Bon Iver_i": "Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon\u2019s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self.\nThere\u2019s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here\u2014impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks\u2014and they are buoyed by Vernon\u2019s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don\u2019t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world.\nThe lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. \u201cI like you/And that ain\u2019t nothing new,\u201d he sings simply on \u201ciMi.\u201d Later, on \u201cRABi,\u201d he observes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all just scared of dying.\u201d These things don\u2019t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like \u201cMarion\u201d and \u201cHolyfields,\u201d are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed.\nStill, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak\u2019s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he\u2019d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single \u201cU (Man Like),\u201d but his presence is enlivening. It\u2019s less lonely to have friends nearby.\nVernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He\u2019s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like \u201cNaeem\u201d is filled with production flourishes\u2014a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver\u2019s \u201cPerth\u201d\u2014yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon\u2019s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to \u201cNaeem\u201d are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (\u201cI fall off a bass boat/And the concrete\u2019s very slow\u201d), but he isn\u2019t hiding behind them. It\u2019s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On \u201cNaeem,\u201d he sings, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll be passing on/Tell them we\u2019re young mastodons,\u201d dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching.\ni,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: \u201cYou were young when you were gave it,\u201d he sings on \u201cWe,\u201d a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. \u201cHey, Ma,\u201d immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. \u201cFull time you talk your money up/While it\u2019s living in a coal mine,\u201d Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster.\nAt first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver\u2019s lyrics. \u201cJelmore,\u201d for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, \u201cWell angel morning sivanna.\u201d And the title for the closing \u201cRABi\u201d comes from the couplet, \u201cI could prophet/I could rob I, however.\u201d There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs\u2019 monikers suggest. There\u2019s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and \u201cRABi\u201d is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. \u201cSunlight feels good now don\u2019t it,\u201d Vernon sings. There\u2019s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. \u201cI don\u2019t have a leaving plan,\u201d he sings, maybe because there\u2019s nowhere else he needs to go.\n\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\n", "Bon Iver_22": "There\u2019s a line deep in Thomas Pynchon\u2019s Inherent Vice wherein Doc, a small-time stoner-sleuth, considers the dissolution of the 1960s, wondering if the decade wasn\u2019t merely \u201ca little parenthesis of light, might close after all, and all be lost, taken back into darkness.\u201d It\u2019s a funny way to think about time\u2014that an entire era can be nudged back into the ether, erased. But on 22, A Million, the extraordinary third full-length from Bon Iver, Justin Vernon echoes Doc\u2019s somber pondering. These are fluttery, skeletal songs that struggle against known trajectories and then threaten to disappear entirely. 22, A Million might be musically distant from For Emma, Forever Ago, the collection of aching folk tunes Vernon debuted in 2007\u2014mostly gone are the acoustic strums, replaced by lurching, electronic gasps born from the Messina, a doctored combination of the Prismizer software plug-in and some hardware that was invented by Vernon and his engineer, Chris Messina. But the albums share an ideology. All things go, taken back into darkness.\n22, A Million is certainly Bon Iver\u2019s most difficult record; it\u2019s the work of a songwriter who seems to have lost interest in established, easily deciphered forms, a possibility Vernon has been hinting at for nearly all of his career. In 2006, Vernon, then living in North Carolina, was emotionally razed by a perfect storm of shitty turns: his band broke up, his relationship dissolved, he came down with an acute case of mononucleosis. He did what any reasonable person with an eye toward self-care would do: decamp to his family\u2019s hunting cabin in rural Wisconsin, drink a gang of beers, watch endless hours of \u201cNorthern Exposure,\u201d and write a batch of lonesome, yearning folk songs on his acoustic guitar. His high, brittle falsetto gave these pieces an otherworldly quality, as if they had blown in on a particularly cold wind.\nFor Emma, Forever Ago was, in its own way, an experimental record\u2014Vernon\u2019s vocals and phrasing are deeply unusual; its stories are impressionistic, fractured\u2014but because it\u2019s so heavy with heartbreak and loss, it feels intimate, authentic, easy. 22, A Million is comparatively strange and exploratory, but its worries are more existential. The album opens with a high, undulating voice (Vernon, singing into an OP-1, a combination synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer) announcing, \u201cIt might be over soon,\u201d and goes on to examine the idea of impermanence. Nearly all of its songs contain a question of some sort, as if Vernon\u2019s own reckoning with the inevitability of decay has led him to interrogate every last thing he\u2019s seen or known. Inasmuch as his lyrics are narrative\u2014and they have always been more connotative than exegetic\u2014he seems preoccupied with whether or not a life has meaning. \u201cOh then, how we gonna cry? Cause it once might not mean something?\u201d he asks on \u201c715 - CR\u03a3\u03a3KS.\u201d\nKanye West once called Vernon his \u201cfavorite living artist,\u201d and has long professed a deep and unexpected admiration for \u201cWoods,\u201d the closing track from 2009\u2019s Blood Bank EP, and an obvious precursor to \u201c715 - CR\u03a3\u03a3KS,\u201d itself a kind of warped a capella jam. \u201cWoods\u201d featured no instrumentation, but is merely five minutes of Vernon singing through Auto-Tune, in ghostly harmony with himself. In retrospect, \u201cWoods\u201d feels like a revelation: it was not only an unexpected affirmation of pop\u2019s future\u2014artists aggressively distorting their vocals, feeding their voices into machines in order to build spectral, nagging songs that reflect alienation, arguably the reigning sensation of our time\u2014but of Vernon\u2019s own trajectory.\nPlenty of beloved contemporary artists, from Dylan to Neil Young on, have ditched the supposed purity of folk music to push the work harder, to make art that\u2019s less reliant on a tradition and invests, instead, in the strangeness of the present moment and collective uncertainty about the future. Trading on preexisting pathways\u2014it\u2019s too easy. Vernon isn\u2019t alone in his hunger for true, tectonic innovation, for songs that seem tethered to and reflective of their actual time and place: Radiohead has been mirroring anxiety about the encroachment of electronics and virtual living since Kid A, a record that also required them to warp if not abandon their beginnings as a guitar-rock band.\nBeyond its sonic striving, 22, A Million is also a personal record about how to move forward through disorienting times. Vernon occasionally employs religious language to express his anxiety, some explicit (\u201cconsecration,\u201d \u201cconfirmation\u201d), some more plainly vernacular (\u201cSo as I\u2019m standing at the station,\u201d \u201cI could go forward in the light\u201d). He samples two gospel tunes: Mahalia Jackson\u2019s live version of \u201cHow I Got Over,\u201d from 1962, and the Supreme Jubilees\u2019s \u201cStanding in the Need of Prayer,\u201d from 1980. There is a song titled \u201c666 \u0287,\u201d and another titled \u201c33 \u2018GOD.\u2019\u201d A bit of marginalia in the album\u2019s liner notes (\u201cWhy are you so FAR from saving me?\u201d) is attributed to Psalm 22, though in the King James Bible, that imploration is for help, not salvation (\u201cWhy art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?\u201d). Either way, Psalm 22 opens in medias res: its author is undergoing an urgent crisis of faith. So is Vernon?\nMaybe. Musically, Vernon resists not just verse-chorus-verse, but all the ways in which Western cultures have come to conceptualize narrative. As kids, we\u2019re taught how stories work, and we use that rubric to organize and make sense of the events of our lives. But the imposition of structure can be violent; perhaps, Vernon suggests, the idea that we are organizing events at all is patently nuts. So when he ventures a line like \u201cWe\u2019ve galvanized the squall of it all,\u201d from \u201c8 (circle),\u201d it feels like a mission statement. There is solace in resisting formal structures, in both acknowledging and embracing a certain amount of chaos.\nIt\u2019s the same story on \u201c00000 Million,\u201d the album\u2019s haunting closing track, where Vernon samples a wobbly line borrowed from the Irish folksinger Fionn Regan: \u201cThe days have no numbers.\u201d Pitted against the record\u2019s obsessive numerology\u2014each song has a number in its title\u2014it lands like an admission of defeat. There\u2019s resignation in his voice, which gives way to desolation. The song\u2019s lyrics will be familiar to anyone wondering if they\u2019ll ever actually start to feel better, while still continuing to do something they know is hurting them: \u201cIf it\u2019s harmed, it harmed me, it\u2019ll harm me, I let it in.\u201d\nFor a while now, Vernon has been building songs in a modular way, and there are moments here (like the meandering last minute of \u201c21 M\u2662\u2662N WATER\u201d) where it feels as if he could\u2019ve jiggled the pieces together a little more\u2014where his disavowal of connective tissue feels less deliberate than random. This is evident, in part, because he is exceptionally good at writing melancholic laments in the highly structured style of \u201980s soft-rock giants like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby (Vernon has covered Raitt\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me,\u201d and Vernon and Hornsby have collaborated on several occasions; \u201c00000 Million\u201d feels like it could have been recorded by either).\n\u201c8 (circle)\u201d is the most immediately reminiscent of Vernon\u2019s last record, Bon Iver, Bon Iver, itself now recognizable as a clear midpoint between Emma and here; it\u2019s also the album\u2019s most conventionally composed track, with the smallest amount of vocal manipulation. Elsewhere, Vernon\u2019s vocals are filtered until they begin to actually dissolve, as if they have been dunked in a tub of lye. The song\u2019s stunning emotional peaks\u2014I come to a full stop every time I hear Vernon sing, \u201cI\u2019m standing in the street now, and I carry his guitar,\u201d his voice steady and deep, as if he\u2019s announcing himself to someone he loves\u2014are so plainly beautiful it\u2019s hard not to mourn, briefly, for the Bon Iver of yesteryear.\nBut 22, A Million sounds only like itself. There are precedents for all of Vernon\u2019s moves deep in the histories of rock\u2018n\u2019roll and rhythm and blues and electronic music\u2014and, more immediately, on newer records by West, Frank Ocean, James Blake, Chance the Rapper, Francis and the Lights, and Radiohead. But this particular amalgamation is so twitchy and idiosyncratic it feels truly singular. Its searching is bottomless.\n", "Bon Iver_A Million": "There\u2019s a line deep in Thomas Pynchon\u2019s Inherent Vice wherein Doc, a small-time stoner-sleuth, considers the dissolution of the 1960s, wondering if the decade wasn\u2019t merely \u201ca little parenthesis of light, might close after all, and all be lost, taken back into darkness.\u201d It\u2019s a funny way to think about time\u2014that an entire era can be nudged back into the ether, erased. But on 22, A Million, the extraordinary third full-length from Bon Iver, Justin Vernon echoes Doc\u2019s somber pondering. These are fluttery, skeletal songs that struggle against known trajectories and then threaten to disappear entirely. 22, A Million might be musically distant from For Emma, Forever Ago, the collection of aching folk tunes Vernon debuted in 2007\u2014mostly gone are the acoustic strums, replaced by lurching, electronic gasps born from the Messina, a doctored combination of the Prismizer software plug-in and some hardware that was invented by Vernon and his engineer, Chris Messina. But the albums share an ideology. All things go, taken back into darkness.\n22, A Million is certainly Bon Iver\u2019s most difficult record; it\u2019s the work of a songwriter who seems to have lost interest in established, easily deciphered forms, a possibility Vernon has been hinting at for nearly all of his career. In 2006, Vernon, then living in North Carolina, was emotionally razed by a perfect storm of shitty turns: his band broke up, his relationship dissolved, he came down with an acute case of mononucleosis. He did what any reasonable person with an eye toward self-care would do: decamp to his family\u2019s hunting cabin in rural Wisconsin, drink a gang of beers, watch endless hours of \u201cNorthern Exposure,\u201d and write a batch of lonesome, yearning folk songs on his acoustic guitar. His high, brittle falsetto gave these pieces an otherworldly quality, as if they had blown in on a particularly cold wind.\nFor Emma, Forever Ago was, in its own way, an experimental record\u2014Vernon\u2019s vocals and phrasing are deeply unusual; its stories are impressionistic, fractured\u2014but because it\u2019s so heavy with heartbreak and loss, it feels intimate, authentic, easy. 22, A Million is comparatively strange and exploratory, but its worries are more existential. The album opens with a high, undulating voice (Vernon, singing into an OP-1, a combination synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer) announcing, \u201cIt might be over soon,\u201d and goes on to examine the idea of impermanence. Nearly all of its songs contain a question of some sort, as if Vernon\u2019s own reckoning with the inevitability of decay has led him to interrogate every last thing he\u2019s seen or known. Inasmuch as his lyrics are narrative\u2014and they have always been more connotative than exegetic\u2014he seems preoccupied with whether or not a life has meaning. \u201cOh then, how we gonna cry?

Remind Me Tomorrow is not a product of this mindset. Just look at the mess on the cover: a tiny photograph of Van Etten barely visible amid the chaos of a kid\u2019s bedroom. It\u2019s an album made after she thought she had let music go for a while, until it crept back in as a reliable constant while she started acting and scoring films, studied for a degree in psychology, embraced a fulfilling relationship, and became a parent. A lesser artist would find a cheap fulfillment narrative in all this. Van Etten characterizes these complicated pleasures as a tempest, and it feels true.\nIt\u2019s her first album made with John Congleton, a producer many acts have turned to in recent years under the guise of wanting to mimic his art-pop work with St. Vincent\u2014a noble but futile game. That is, thankfully, not the case here; nor is it that Van Etten, tired of the guitar, just threw a few synths at the wall. Remind Me Tomorrow is as much a faithful reimagining of her muscular songwriting as last year\u2019s Double Negative was of Low\u2019s haunted spirituals, right down to the shared apocalyptic atmosphere. Corroded synths flicker like a helicopter rotor, cutting her characteristic grace with a sense of menace; the production and Van Etten herself often sound as though they\u2019re asphyxiating. The aggressive sound meets its match in her cresting, torrid sense of melody.\nMore than ever, it\u2019s these uneasy textures that do Van Etten\u2019s storytelling for her. An abusive relationship she experienced in her early 20s has defined much of her songwriting to date, so much so that it started making her feel uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s cathartic to play, and people like it,\u201d she told The Ringer of one old song, \u201cbut I also want to challenge people on why they like it, and how it makes me feel.\u201d Remind Me Tomorrow starts with a disclosure, \u201cI Told You Everything.\u201d \u201cYou said, \u2018Holy shit, you almost died,\u2019\u201d she sings, repeating the line throughout the song and peeling back layer by layer of shock factor until only sad starkness remains. The exchange forms the start of a relationship: held hands, knocked knees, total candor. Crucially, we never find out what she tells him. The restraint is more of a revelation than another addition to the grim details that litter her catalog, explaining everything about Van Etten\u2019s hard-won control over her life.\nAnd yet, Remind Me Tomorrow is not unyielding. It is the peak of Van Etten\u2019s songwriting, her most atmospheric and emotionally piercing album to date. Often when it concerns love, it\u2019s about how tentative it feels: \u201cTurning the wheel on my street/My heart still skips a beat,\u201d she sings on \u201cJupiter 4\u201d (named for the synthesizer behind much of the album), a whirring dirge filled with ghostly cries and thunderclaps. \u201cYou\u2019ll run,\u201d she sings on \u201cMemorial Day,\u201d drawing out the words into a narcotic, sparkling haze. The album\u2019s truest love song, \u201cMalibu,\u201d relishes the memory of a carefree romantic holiday, but Van Etten still highlights the transience of driving down the coast in \u201cthe little red car that don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\nThe most traditionally robust songs on Remind Me Tomorrow are about Van Etten as a teenager, usually a time of confidence that is later revealed to be naivety. \u201cComeback Kid\u201d has a puffed chest and a sense of ragged pride; the standout \u201cSeventeen\u201d exudes the reckless freedom of standing in the sunroof of a moving car and spreading your arms wide. It mixes despair for her poor decisions, nostalgia for that headstrong girl, and anxiety over what she would make of her now. \u201cI know what you\u2019re gonna be,\u201d Van Etten taunts at full vocal power: \u201cYou\u2019ll crumple it up just to see/Afraid that you\u2019ll be just like me!\u201d She gives no indication of who is right: the teenager disgusted at the thought of growing up and joining the straight world, or herself now, wanting to protect that girl who had no idea what difficulties were to come. What do you attempt to hold onto and let go of?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it ends,\u201d Van Etten sings dreamily on \u201cStay,\u201d a reverie of rippling piano and bass that addresses the need for reciprocal support and independence between a mother and her child. It sounds like a resolution, or at least her making peace with how to develop trust when everything can slip away so easily, but the arrangement is still anesthetized, unresolved. Having more to live for, hence more to lose, is rarely soothing. But it\u2019s worth the mess.\n", "Sharon Van Etten_(It Was) Because I Was in Love (Deluxe Reissue)": "No Review", "Sharon Van Etten_Are We There": "From the first notes of her 2009 debut, Because I Was in Love, New Jersey native Sharon Van Etten wrote with seeming effortlessness about the depravations of romance and the contortions of a heart either committed or broken, displaying a penchant for wrenching turns of phrase laden with dire implications. When she sang, \u201cThe moral of the story is don't lie to me again,\u201d on \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d, it was the \u201cagain\u201d that stuck in your gut, suggesting a pattern of aggression and acquiescence that would not necessarily end with the song. Her voice toggled fluidly between brave and broken, dogged and defiant\u2014often within the same line. She whispered, then jumped to a fierce vibrato that could stop an army. Disclosing her darkest moments proved both empowering and unnerving, as though startled by her own strength. Even on her debut, she displayed the poise of a pro.\nAs with so many singer-songwriters\u2014for whom lyrics and vocals take primacy over every other element\u2014Van Etten never sounded quite so self-assured musically. Because I Was in Love showcased her quiet vocals and surprisingly nimble guitarwork, with producer Greg Weeks of Espers mostly staying out of her way. That subdued sound was going to be impossible to sustain for another album, much less an entire career, so it seemed almost inevitable when she introduced a full-band sound, complete with flourishes of pedal steel, on her follow-up, Epic. On 2012\u2019s career-making Tramp, she worked with the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner and emerged with her fullest and most fully realized album to date, even if it occasionally sounded overly decorous, even fussy. Her catalog has been a series of trials and experiments, driven by restlessness and perfectionism in equal measure, although weirdly the transitions between albums only serve to render each one more volatile and unpredictable.\nIt is, then, notable that Van Etten herself produced her fourth album, Are We There, with some assistance from Stewart Lerman. The two met while working on the second soundtrack to Boardwalk Empire and decamped to his New Jersey studio to record these new songs. Lerman\u2019s work with Loudon Wainwright III, the Roches, and other singer-songwriters makes him a good fit for Van Etten, but perhaps more than any of her previous records Are We There sounds self-determined and self-directed. The music fits snugly against her vocals, with her guitar and piano foregrounded on opener \u201cAfraid of Nothing\u201d. As a result, these songs move fluidly and dramatically, but never ostentatiously. Even the woodwinds on \u201cTarifa\u201d sound understated, as though careful not to distract from Van Etten\u2019s performance.\nIt\u2019s the most comfortable she\u2019s sounded since Because I Was in Love, which is not to say the music lacks color or character. \u201cYour Love Is Killing Me\u201d is built on a Jenga-style assemblage of post-rock guitars and jittery snare taps, and even as it sprawls into a six-minute jam (her longest song to date), it never topples. Instead, the music only reinforces her repeated proclamation, \u201cYou tell me that you like it.\u201d Elsewhere, Are We There softens and quietens. A purposefully stiff drum loop lends \u201cTaking Chances\u201d its brooding, conspiratorial tone, reining in the chorus and setting up an effective one-chord organ solo. The stark piano on \u201cI Love You But I\u2019m Lost\u201d flutters nervously, as though reminding you that Van Etten\u2019s whispers can convey screams. There is a live quality to the music, as though she has crafted each note with concerts in mind. Her songs emphasize the moment, both in the quality of her performance and in the rawness of her lyrics. As a result, Are We There may be her most present-tense album to date, her most immediate and urgent\u2014the peak of a steady upward trajectory.\nEven as she has settled into a successful solo career, Van Etten continues to write incisively about the volatility of love, with no loss of urgency or investment. Her songs tend to be excruciatingly confessional, largely indistinguishable from the singer herself, and Are We There reveals a new self-awareness with regard to her primary subject. On \u201cI Know\u201d, which features Van Etten alone on piano, she declares, \u201cI sing about my fear and love and what it brings,\u201d as though we didn\u2019t know that already. On closer \u201cEvery Time the Sun Comes Up\u201d, she asks, not entirely rhetorically, \u201cPeople say I'm a one hit wonder, but what happens when I have two?\u201d It\u2019s a sly way to preempt any complaint that she has only one emotional or musical setting, but the next line turns the song upside-down: \u201cI washed your dishes, then I shit in your bathroom.\u201d Recently, Van Etten told Pitchfork\u00a0that the line was originally a joke with her band, but it\u2019s not hard to see why this incredibly anti-romantic line would have stayed in. It reveals the driving idea behind the album: It\u2019s not the big moments that define or doom a relationship, but the everyday routines, the small sacrifices that accumulate over time, the stark realities of sharing your life with another person. You see them at their best and their worst, their most beautiful and their most vulgar. To her credit, Van Etten has never shrunk from this horrible and wonderful understanding.\n", "Sharon Van Etten_Tramp (Deluxe Edition)": "No Review", "Sharon Van Etten_Tramp": "Sharon Van Etten's first proper album,\u00a0Because I Was in Love, was nudged out into the world in 2009 despite the best efforts of a college boyfriend in Tennessee who had told her she was shit, hid her guitar, and shoved her back home to New Jersey. That album's tracks, and those of the home recordings she also released that year,\u00a0were sparse, Van Etten's voice sometimes barely above a murmur, as if she were trying to figure out how to make music at the lowest functional volume. Her next record, 2010's Epic, was almost more of an EP-- just seven songs-- but it was a leap forward in sound and spirit. Epic pulled in little bits of kickdrum and pedal steel and electric guitar, and ended with \"Love More\", on which she proclaimed, over a doubled harmonium and wavering synth, \"You chained me like a dog in our room/ \u2026It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more.\"\nVan Etten first recorded \"Love More\" for WXPN and Weathervane Music's Shaking Through web series, which captured the session on video. It was one of her first in-earnest collaborations with other musicians, and can almost see new synapses firing behind her eyes: this is what music can be, this is what I can be. It's fitting that the same song grabbed the attention of the National's Aaron Dessner, who wound up producing\u00a0Tramp, her first album for Jagjaguwar. The new tracks come from a year and a half of sessions wedged in whenever Dessner and Van Etten were both off tour. It includes appearances by Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, Julianna Barwick, Dessner's brother/bandmate Bryce, and other friends of the sort that apparently tend to \"just drop by\" when you're a celebrated musician/producer with a studio in your Brooklyn garage. That Van Etten has been given the time and space and resources to feel out her path, unhurried by the tyrannous buzz cycle, is both a total luxury, and totally vital.\nIt's the default assumption that a female songwriter, performing under her own name, is \"confessional,\" that she's serving up some dark part of her soul for the world's consumption. And maybe one day Van Etten will slip into the voices of strangers just as easily as she inhabits her own. But for now, confession is still very much the thing. \"It's self-therapy,\" Van Etten has said to nearly every interviewer who has asked, and more and more that seems to refer to both the writing and the production of her songs; that she can draw out the words, bring them into a room with other human beings, and together with them lay something beautiful on tape is both transformative and redemptive.\nMatters of mistrust, isolation, and uncomfortable togetherness dominate Tramp, rolling through every track like a sick, creeping fog. Maybe Van Etten is still nursing the psychic wounds carved into her by that one Tennessee boyfriend, or maybe it's something else; either way, she sounds, at last, good and angry and ready to put up a fight. First comes the dark jangle of \"Warsaw\", then the calculated frankness of \"Give Out\" (\"You're the reason why I'll move to the city/ Or why I'll need to leave\u201d). On \"Serpents\", the album's lead single, she scoffs, \"I had a thought you would take me seriously.\" As guitars strain at their tethers and Walkmen drummer Matt Barrick pounds out marching orders, the plea she issued three years ago on \"Much More Than That\"-- \"please don\u2019t take me lightly\"-- quavers, crumples, turns to ash.\nAfter the torching comes the slow, steady burn. \"Kevin's\" sounds like an Epic latecomer welcomed into Tramp's fold, Van Etten\u2019s voice, falling somewhere between Cass Elliot's range and Cat Power's emotional register, turns darker and resigned, the whole song one long smoky exhale. \"Leonard\" is a dreamy, abashed waltz; tickled by ukuleles and kicked along by a big bass drum; it reveals the album's lone confession that seems to stem from anything close to guilt. It's an admission that takes three go-rounds of the chorus to make itself fully known, Van Etten shuffling around the hard truth: \"I am bad\"-- \"I am bad at loving\"-- \"I am bad at loving you.\"\nThe album's brightest spot comes with the steady, strummy \"We Are Fine\", in which Van Etten talks through a panic attack with a friend (\"Take my hand and help me not to shake/ Say I'm all right, I'm all right\").\u00a0Beirut's Zach Condon sings harmonies and a verse of his own, the song written with him in mind, Van Etten\u00a0says, not just because she first plucked it out on a ukulele, but because they both do battle with the gnarly beast of social anxiety.\u00a0There's often no clear balm for Van Etten's laments, but \"We Are Fine\" is both the means and the end, the sickness and the cure in one.\nTramp is maybe best thought of in terms of having a Side A and a Side B; otherwise, the middle section falls into a weird mid-album slough that doesn't quite jibe with Van Etten and Dessner's generally excellent sense of timing and space. Imagine a click, a pause and a careful flip between the fractured, meandering \"In Line\" and \"All I Can\", which starts with a mewling organ hum and gradually wills itself into blistering hugeness. That song might have worked, too, as a big closer; the seething \"Joke or a Lie\" serves better as a feint than a final attack. As it is, the album doesn't end so much as infinitely loop on itself (serpents, indeed), the last track's final scrape threading back into \"Warsaw\"'s opening thump and clank.\n\"I want my scars to help and heal,\" Van Etten sings on \"All I Can\". That healing comes, in part, from the making of the music-- that act of physically locating the pain in some way that can be accessed and then shelved as life tumbles on. But it comes, too, from being pushed out into the world, to people who now say, \"Yes, we are here, and we are listening.\"\n", "Sharon Van Etten_Epic": "This past April, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon stood alone on stage at Memorial Hall in Cincinnati and played a song entitled \"Love More\". It was not a new Bon Iver tune but a cover culled from the songbook of Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten. The way Vernon wandered through the slow, often overwhelming beauty of that song, one walked away from it feeling as if he needed to hear more from and about Van Etten. It's a song that seizes you.\nVan Etten came to Brooklyn by way of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and her parents' basement in New Jersey. Her first album, the self-released Because I Was In Love, was a tuneful set of simple, spare, acoustic-based travails. It wasn't remarkable, but at its heart was a voice that begged to be uncovered: an instrument as chilling as it was opaque, as wounded as the title of the record seemed to suggest. Epic, her first wide release, feels like the unveiling of her full talents. Classic songwriting with an ethereal delivery is central to her appeal, but it's her sense of confidence that really sells it, as the first lines of opener \"A Crime\" attest:\u00a0\"To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime/ To admit I'm still in love with you after all this time/ I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die.\" On paper, those words might read a bit like coffee-shop fodder. But the cool grace with which Van Etten belts every line, and the dangerous force with which she strums every first count, make for an explosive sound that didn't seem possible from her earlier. She sounds as though she's arrived.\nFrom there, Van Etten doesn't loosen her grip. As Epic progresses, her vocals couple with an array of sonics and styles (see: the pedal-steel country saunter of \"Save Yourself\", the electric punch of \"Peace Sign\"), though it's the slower, more atmospheric numbers that remain the album's most arresting. \"DsharpG\" is one gorgeous, six-minute crescendo, Van Etten's voice haloed by Mellotron and kick drum. Lyrically, she explores relationships from a number of vantage points, and Epic was recorded so intimately that Van Etten sounds as close as she does gutted. It all comes together on the hopeful tones of \"Love More\", as her voice pirouettes and heaves over a story of learning to love again in spite of pain: \"Tied to my bed, I was younger then, I had nothing to spend,\" she sighs. \"But time on you, it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more.\" And so the titular mantra unfolds. It's one of the more emotionally draining songs I can remember hearing, and yet as soon as it's over, it turns out I want to listen again.\n", "Sharon Van Etten_Because I Was In Love": "Fans of acoustic guitar-playing female singer-songwriters are so flooded with options these days that they are in the position to be pretty discriminating. Artists such as Alela Diane, Marissa Nadler, Jana Hunter, and Mariee Sioux have issued a steady stream of quality music, and have collectively set a fairly high standard for newcomers to match. Yet on her debut full-length album, Because I Was in Love, Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten proves that she has the expressive voice and the songwriting chops to ably hold her own in the company of her peers.\nAs with the aforementioned artists, Van Etten's work retains some echoes of folk tradition but generally operates in a more personal, introspective space. Following a number of hand-designed and self-released recordings, a 2008 tour with Meg Baird brought Van Etten into the orbit of Philadelphia's Espers, whose Greg Weeks recorded Because I Was in Love at Hexham Head studio. With Weeks' veteran assistance, Van Etten keeps the album's arrangements minimal and direct, augmenting her voice and guitar with only the occasional splash of organ, brushed cymbals, or multi-tracked vocal harmonies.\nThough the arrangements are spare, the performances on Because I Was in Love are not skeletal-- these are full-bodied songs that sound finished, as though Van Etten had already lived with this material long enough to know intuitively how best to present it. In this regard Van Etten's work can resemble Chan Marshall's earliest Cat Power recordings, especially in the way that Van Etten's confident, nuanced soprano is able to help temper the emotional fragility of her material.\nAs the title suggests, Because I Was In Love spends most of its time chronicling the bittersweet ache and light-headed confusion that can only arise through the ebbs and flows of romance. Unlike some low-key vocalists who prefer to sing as if nobody were listening, Van Etten instead sings these songs as though she had an audience of one, with nearly every lyric directed straight to some unnamed \"you.\" And, at the risk of conflating the performer with her performance, suffice to say that throughout the album Van Etten really nails it, sounding every bit like someone trying to get her head around a complex and evolving relationship.\nOn opener \"I Wish I Knew\" or the sumptuous \"Much More Than That\", Van Etten writes with such intimacy (her lyrics filled with direct lines like, \"I wish I knew what to do with you,\" or \"Please don't take me lightly\") that the listener gets an almost disconcerting sense of eavesdropping on a private conversation. Elsewhere, as on \"Tornado\" or the captivating \"Consolation Prize\", Van Etten sounds more reflective, keeping a measured distance from her narratives, even if her songs' ultimate conclusions (\"The moral of the story is don't lie to me again\") recognize the impossibility of pat endings and easy solutions.\nMost crucial to the album's success, however, is Van Etten's unerring sense for crafting memorable, seductive melodies. Here again she takes no shortcuts, as she largely forgoes standard verse-chorus repetition in favor of a more organic style, with wonderful songs like \"For You\" and \"Holding Out\" gently unwinding like the lines across a hand-drawn road map. Even in a folk scene that can sometimes feel over-crowded, Because I Was in Love positions Sharon Van Etten immediately towards the front of the pack.\n", "Current Joys _Live at Kilby Court": "No Review", "Current Joys _A Different Age": "No Review", "Current Joys _Me Oh My Mirror": "No Review", "Current Joys _2013": "No Review", "Current Joys _B-Sides": "No Review", "Current Joys _Rarities and Demos": "No Review", "Current Joys _Young Love / No One Will Dance / Neon Gold": "No Review", "Current Joys _Wild Heart": "No Review"}
